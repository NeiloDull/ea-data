## improve_survey_comment  ##



The question should be : How can we improve EA  and the EA community and communication?

The survey implicitly assumes a lot about channels of doing EA work, e.g., "volunteer" hours. It's actually quite hard to engage with it if you've been optimizing hard for EA ends for a long time because (for me, anyway), the implicit assumptions don't apply.

Put the most common options first e.g. US, UK for country

I am a student, but I was asked which industry I work in. I answered education, but to discriminate me from academic staff you might want to add a 'student' or 'unemployed' category.

Focus also in volunteering

The current employment question did not offer an option to select "Effective Altruism." Given I work full time for an EA organisation this presented me with a dilemma about whether to select "Nonprofit," which is somewhat misleading, or write in "Effective Altruism." This could be solved by having a yes or no question which asks if you currently work for an EA org.

Tell me how many questions there are in advance.     Give a direct link at the end to the current results.

N/A

This version was much better (i.e. shorter) than the previous one. However, I don't really like answering the same couple of questions (e.g. how I got involved, where did I hear about the EA the first time, etc.....) multiple times a year - in EA survey, in 80k survey and elsewhere. Would it be possible to create some kind of "profiles" in which I would answer these questions just once and next time 80k or EA survey or anyone else in the community wanted me to fill in their questionnaire these questions would be pre-filled so I dont have to fill them in again? This would also allow you to conduct some longitudinal research e.g. into how does the preference of EA causes changes over the time WITHIN participants or in case of 80k they could see how people gradually leaning towards EA careers - in my opinion it would be much better than comparing group results. Or is there any chance you can connect my results with the ones from previous year? even if I wanted I probably wouldn't be able to recollect e.g. which causes did I prefer last year. You can offer the option of "creating a profile" for example in the very end of the survey which would save all the data and users might be more willing to save all the work they have put into filling the survey as some E-shops/airlines do it.

Some of the answers don't make sense and I would like to give context. E.g. a new group is starting in my country - it skews a lot of the answers.

1. It would be interesting to know the donation allocation between EA vs. not EA charities.  2. I am in an open relationship, which in my opinion is neither monogamous nor polymorous. No "other" option was given.

Wow this was intrusive. Why not ask my shoe size while you're at it?

Include S-Risks as a cause. Even MacAskill mentions them nowadays! More questions about what developments we like and what we currently don't like in the movement. Wasn't the last survey longer in that regard?

You might want to let people know that they might be uniquely identifiable by someone familiar with the EA community if they answer all questions. I.e. this survey is pseudo-anonymous rather than anonymous.    (I think there are more than 10 people, and potentially up to 100, who will be able to identify me based on the responses I gave, but that's OK with me.)

Very good job on providing "estimate time to complete the survey"

Ask questions about the mental health of the members and how connected they feel within the community.

After being asked about the country we live in, the selection of cities could be adapted. It also takes as granted that people live in cities and not in smaller settlements

Yes - the list of cities that people are from seems very limited and US-centric - I picked London even though it is the other side of the country!

* Ask for survey improvement ideas BEFORE releasing the survey.  * Survey question ideas in this thread http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1g3/why_how_to_make_progress_on_diversity_inclusion/

Use a different questioning scheme for the question with the priorities.. The way it is now, while spotting the top priorities of each survey taker, it fails to to extract the information of the real prioritisation. I think it would be better to let people rank the different causes in an order.

a few ideas:   Ask what information EA's would like more of?  Ask what support would EA's would like more of?  Ask what resources would EA's not need more of?  after survey - create a representative sample and ask if they would be available for "flash" survey input from time to time - for future input on topics.

You need to be more specific when asking "how much have you donated?", since I donate to EA causes like GiveWell/AMF, but also to non-EA things like EFF/DonorsChoose

Allow us to download our results so I can see what I said in previous surveys.

The city list was a bit odd. It would make sense to constrain it to the country selected.

Maybe introduce the question on occupation before the income question, 'cause that's how it's done in most surveys and I was confused if it was gonna ask.   Otherwise it's agreat survey! Yay survey design!   Thanks for doing the work you guys do.

Replace: "Direct Work at Charity or Non-Profit" with "Direct Work, e.g. Charity or Non-Profit". Because if I'm working in industry or policy sector on responsible deployment of AI (that is not a Non-Profit) I shouldn't have to check "Earning to Give"

Refer to "Animal rights/welfare" as "Nonhuman rights/welfare" as it's generally a more accurate framing (humans are animals, etc).  Separate options for Atheist and agnostic in religious options, as they are considerably different beliefs.

Indicate the percentage of the survey that I have already completed, to give a sense of progress / remaining questions.

Maybe more questions about how people get involved, or ask if someone (select few) wants to do follow-up to get a better grip on that

Provide a written response option for gender, rather than just "other".

tell of findings and outcomes from previous years' survey

Not sure if I took part in the survey last year.

Include a text box to describe the "other" religious belief. Like mine is pantheist/spiritual, so I feel like it doesn't belong in any other category.

Keep being awesome ^.^

Add an "I don't remember" option for whether I took the last survey.

You need a place to say if people work for an EA org right now! That makes things like the volunteer question a bit odd for someone like me, who works full time at CEA. If I didn't I might indeed volunteer.

I dont know

Question 35 'highest level of education': As a programmer I noticed it didn't mention code school, or self-teaching. People who specialize in other areas may notice other things that are missing (which may or may not be solely relevant to their area of expertise).

Good survey, not too long

On 'how are you involved' there's no 'I used to go but now I don't' option

Adapting income boxes to more flexible circumstances, ask questions about future EA plans not just current EA activity

Clarify education level - I wasn't totally confident about whether a medical degree counts as 'professional degree'.     Add 'not in employment' option to 'what sector is the organisation you work for in' question.

Have a free text box for gender.

By making more effort/using different strategies to advertise it in order to get a bigger pool of participants for the survey. Judging by the membership of local and global facebook groups, it looks like there are way more self-identified EAs than the amount that answer this survey. I only found about it by chance myself.

I am not a member of the EA community, but some of the questions assume I am.

Please, add the option "Software", "IT" or something like this to the question 37, about industry. Yes many programmers do actually work in finance, government or whatever. But some companies really do specialize in software, like Oracle or Red Hat - you might have heard about them.

Maybe state how many questions there is, or give an estimate of the time it takes.    Perhaps ask, optionally, for an email address to send follow-up information.

You ought to have given an "I don't remember" option for question 39.

- is it monthly or yearly household income?!  - the scale in the cause priorization matrix probably does not produce valid results. it is not a clear increasing scale

Circle back with the overall results and what you will be doing to action any recommendations

Great survey, easy to answer and good choice of responses :)

Some of the cause priority questions were weird. How would I prioritize cause prioritization, for example?

Some of the choices don't give a "No" option.  Like the 80,000 hours career counseling question...I don't receiving coaching and don't want coaching.

Allow people to check multiple for the religious category (I'm Jewish & atheist).

clarify questions to separate EA movement from individuals who are aligned but not part of the movement.

More questions on improving EA, more self-reflection.

Ask more questions about political and philosophical issues

Checkboxes for gender question

Reassure us that survey responses are saved.  Show a progress bar of the percentage of the survey I have done.

Add startups and skill building towards startups as an option (it only says charities/non profits)

The issues you ask us to prioritize are not inclusive of the real core systematic problems that we need to address in order for altruism to be sustainable and for the people.

Some of the Hyperlinks dont work

I think so?

Sexual orientation question; allow people to type in their ethnicity.

For cause prioritization, make it a numbered ranked list (with allowances for equal ranking if desired but honestly I think nonequal forces more info)

There are some questions where the distinction between effective altruism the idea and EA the organization are blurred.

Pas de question sur les finances

When selecting boxes my keypad comes up even if im not in a text input box.

Please define and/or give more information about household and individual income. As a non native english speaker I had to research the information and I am not sure if I found the information you were looking for.

I already mentioned, dont include a broad range of social sciences only under "social science". IR and Law deserves its place, so as legal services and politics in term of my occupation.

Help people remember if they took it or not already

Multiple survey links are confusing.  It makes it hard to authenticate a link.  Please use separate survey=&delivery_method= parameters so that I can use a delivery-method-tracked link with confidence that I am taking the real survey.    Is this a typo?: "18. Are there any other causes *you feel* that *you feel* are priorities?"

Have an option to send us a copy thru email of what we have answered

:) Im joking, It's really oright.             ty ok.

It was unclear as someone who is currently a student if I should check "some college but no degree" or "bachelors degree". It was unclear if I should check "education" because the organization I work for is a university, or if I should check "software engineering" because the organization I will intern for this summer is a tech company.

Ask stuff like: "Do you feel EA is moving into the right direction politically? Should it move more to the right or to the left?"

It should me more focused on what people expect to do as effective altruists, rather than how much money people expect to donate.

be more vegan

Asking about experiencing sexual abuse/any other discriminating/negative experience within the EA community would be interesting.

I think you should include some more questions about how much we value different parts of the EA movement / ideas / development (e.g. from 1 to 5, how well organised do you think the community is etc.).

Have a "kind of" box in addition to "yes" and "no".

Increase transparency why the data is gathered and how it is used purposefully

There was a typo in Question 18 =) A few duplicated words.

Local Linkedin group / local job search support

Politics question: centred on what?  US or UK or Chinese politics?  Better to do a mini 2d politics survey to get some meaningful info.  Otherwise all you get is where people see themselves compared to a random sample of people they are thinking about at the moment.

Try to have consistent questions from year to year so we can compare across years.

Make it longer and send out free EA stickers to respondents

Not sure

How popular is EA amongst family and friends?  How many high school or below students do you know interested in EA? what is most compelling reason not to be effective altruist? (Reworded) how many people have you persuaded/introduced EA to?

More questions about polyamory, that shit is interesting    JK. More questions on how EA groups / the EA movement can improve. I know many people, including myself, with deep concerns about EA groups and their effectiveness. A local EA group I've been a member of before doesn't really do much other than reachout events a few times a year and weekly meetings about basic EA topics, which is a big issue IMO. Even EA Global seems like a big waste of money to me, which could be super arrogant of me to say considering I've never been there, but from what I can tell people are individually spending thousands of dollars to attend an event when that money could do way more good elsewhere.    But of course that's a long discussion. My main point is that you might find it useful to get people's thoughts on this stuff within the EA Survey.

Have a question which can (noisily probably but ideally not) track attrition rates of long term members.

Would be great to use it as a tool to assemble local groups.

The survey doesn't seem to take into account that many in the EA movement actually work at EA(-minded) organizations. E.g. the question about how much time one volunteers is rather confusing.

"Which industry do you work in" needs a "I am not employed" option

Some questions should probably be more precise. E.g. how did you get into effective altruism? Does it ask what my first contact was? Does it ask what had the largest influence for me becoming into EA?

Dunno

Additional comment boxes should be provided for people who don't really match with any of the provided options (including 'others')

Given that malaria and "deworming" are such high priorities to many EA's, seems like a good idea to have global health in the list of causes.

collect information about whether participants have tried to spread the word about EA to family, friends etc

It's pretty good, well Done

Don't ask for the income. It doesn't matter

I tried just yesterday to find the 2017 results on political affiliation and couldn't

It would be interesting to ask how often the person brings up EA and explains it to their acquaintances / how many people within their circle are aware of AI

Ask questions about what is turning people away, what made people get more active, and what support do EAs need.

Seems ok!

_Ÿê™_Ÿê™_Ÿê™

Gather data on ripple effect?

provide the Other or comment box answer choice in more, most, or all questions

More open to uncertain people

If it's more succinct it's better

Make it less biased towards people who approve of how Effective Altruism is run. The Effective Altruism charity is highly flawed, but this survey doesn't let me express this opinion or explain why.

add questions like: "what is preventing you from being more involved in EA?"

You're assuming a consensus over EA goals and means that I likely don't share. Consider adding question on what EA means to your subjects.

Include more diverse gender options and perhaps a section on sexual orientation. Would also be interesting to get minoritiesâ€™ perspectives (ethnic, gender, etc.) on how EA treats them as minorities - I think diversity in EA is a major issue and we should track our progress regarding how we welcome people from minority backgrounds.

An option to make it quicker to take if you have taken it in the past.    Make sure results are being used. In particular talk to local groups and make the survey useful for them to measure impact.    The questions on when first find out about EA at confusing because EA didn't really exist until 2011/2012 but earlier years are listed.

Drop down list of countries should have the three most common countries listed twice, once at the top and once in alphabetical order. Do this and 99% of people won't have to waste time scrolling down.

There was one awkward grammar issue (feel...feel priority cause).  Otherwise, it was quite ideal and quicker than I expected, which is good.

slightly more detailed questions as some left me thinking that none of the answers applied to me

I prefer Google Forms or Typeform but everything is super clear! Maybe some information about values/political beliefs would be interesting. Otherwise, great :)

Understanding what activities make people feel most involved in the community (eg what can meet ups / local communities do?)

Please give me the links and websites to the other effective altruism groups in my email ( including fb groups) provide career advice, and maybe mentorship oppurtunites, I would like to talk to someone about my future

Is effective Altruism a known concept within your peers?

This survey took me longer than 5-10 minutes. However, I think it is good questions you have asked. I would like to have had te possibility to give comments on most (maybe even all) of the question to clarify some things. Especially as I wasn't sure which option to pick when there were no "other" option on some questions.

City list could have autocompletion instead of a limited list of cities.

it might be interesting to measure in more detail the level of involvement of self-defined EAs

Don't assume I'm here because I already support EA. I joined the newsletter because enough people strongly endorse these ideals that I wanted to learn about them to assess them for myself, but I'm not currently convinced. In particular, the EA community seems to have an extremely narrow overton window for want "altruism" or "moral good" might be, so even though I believe in optimization I'm not sure my moral beliefs give me a place in the EA community. (No, I'm not "evil", just perhaps more Machiavellian+ preference-utilitarian than most...)

Hoping at the end it will say something to reiterate what EA encourages (including finding groups, if so)

FYI, I can't remember if I did the survey last year, but I probably did.

Household income is hard to estimate in share houses. Provide some guidance for that.

More write in options about religion. I would've inputted that I was raised Christian and identify as Christian, but that I haven't been practicing and am agnostic.

Give option to drop e-mail adress to get results send .

I don't know how to improve the survey because I don't know what its purpose is.

1. That someone is not involved in a local group near them does not mean they cannot be quite involved with a local group they visit often - which is a possibility that did not seem to be acknowledged by the questions.    2. It would be nice if the "other" option for religious identification had a slot for elaboration.    3. It would be nice to be able to opt out of the finance and donation questions, Ã  la "prefer not to answer" (instead of just not filling them), and also to explain why one is opting out.    4. Wouldn't it be quite useful to ask if a person works or has worked for an EA org? I put "nonprofit" in the industry for my work, because a lot of my freelance time is booked by 80,000 Hours.     Thanks so much for doing this!

SHORTEN IT!

Allow choosing several options in question 15.

Remember for me whether I've taken the survey in previous years (and whether I've already taken it this year).

Iâ€™d be interested in asking people how much they donate to each cause area. Not sure if itâ€™s be *useful* but interesting.

Ask more open-ended questions about general perception of EA philosophy.

Have a progress bar or note at the beginning how many questions they are.  Also, the city/town question is a little weird to answer if you don't live in one of the listed cities so perhaps consider revising.  Thanks for all your good work!!

include law. also some longer form optional answers? also split the questions with multiple sub questions into smaller areas

it's too long

Add progress bar or percentage

> 15. What broad career path are you planning to follow?    This one could've been better, I think. I'm not sure which one I will choose, so I had a hard time answering. Adding a "not sure" or "Torn between Earning to give/direct charity" would've been good.    > You should have a question about strategies used to make sure you actually keep giving, and keep giving more (as a percentage) of your income as it keeps growing. I fear many fall in the trap of getting used to higher salaries, and so going into the career with a "pure heart" but getting "corrupted" along the way. A clear strategy is needed for most, I think.    > 31. Which of the following choices best represents your religious beliefs?    There should've been a "spiritual" or something like that option there, I think.    > 32. Which of the following options best represent your political belief    I would've liked a "Green" option here.    > Links to explanations on the list of causes would've been nice.

Ask for suggestions to improve "EA" (I think - consider doing more marketing/advertising)    Ask about negative experiences (inappropriate behaviour, harassment, etc)

Ask weird/cool optional questions like the LW and SSC surveys. Ask about birth order, personality types, family income growing up, things people do/don't like about EA, LGBT status, results on personality tests, etc. so we figure out who EAs really are

Question 37, "Which of the following best describes the principal industry of the organization you work for?" would benefit from an option for those not working, like the other questions supplied.

Use this survey to gather ideas on spreading the movement and making it mainstream. I myself am coming from the mainstream and find EA a little bit extreme and homogenous, though I can deal. I think the core principles behind EA are valuable and universal but need some mainstream-ified talking points if we want to effect mindset shift.

Provide meetup opportunities / networking

Please consider including questions providing more insights on the well-being and socio-economic life circumstances of effective altruists. Your survey might be very helpful in identifying and addressing many of their problems, leading to adjustments and multiplication of the chapters' positive impact.

Consider asking broadly why people have/haven't taken the pledge and the reason for their level of giving.

2.No answers should end the survey. 9. Option for taken the pledge privately but not declared publicly? 15. Option for a combination? 19. Option for different currency in different years? (Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not that unusual in moving around - weâ€™re likely to be a mobile bunch!) 34. Option for freelance? (Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s quite a few!) 37. Display conditional on employment. 39. Yes / no questions - include â€˜donâ€™t knowâ€™ option. A few suggestions - I used to design surveys for a living!

One of the early questions really makes an assumption that most of the people taking this survey are college age.   That is odd for a movement that has been around as long as this one has.

make it a bit shorter ;-)

I felt that the study did not apply too much to me as a 19 year old, but I guess that is just the nature of things. Maybie shape some questions or options more open to such a demographic

I can't think of any suggestions this year, it seems good!

Consider getting demographic data on education, parents' income, and disability to learn more about the make-up of our movement.

Add more interesting questions or options - e.g. even more causes

Ask for new ideas on how EAs can make an impact outside of career alignment or donations, for example could political and policy movements become a key point of action for people interested in certain issues?

Its fine

Maybe an option about EA local groups for cities where about only you are interested, if you want to attend but have a hard time organizing it, getting people to come etc.

Would like it if it had a question about disability or something, i am high functioning autistic - suffer from depression

Rewriting questions to be less loaded

Itâ€™s irritating to me that it sometimes feels like youâ€™re not a real EA if youâ€™re not in tech or in direct action (which for some people is a way bigger step than donating 10%! Maybe you have a job you love! We donâ€™t expect people to live lives of pure aesceticism when theyâ€™re earning to give so I donâ€™t know why we have to pressure people into DA work all day every day). But anyway. I think the survey feels unwelcoming by having a million techy job option selections and then lumping all of social sciences together. Or by having lots of questions about DA and 80k hours. It feels judgey.

I find the question of race/ethnicity confusing and offensive. I've never been asked this, nor have I ever considered the matter, and I find it very strange that I should have or choose some race or ethnicity.

You should ask if single people consider themselves as polyamorous.   You should ask if people who are currently employed are looking for another job

Typically, surveys that provide an "Other" option include a small, character limited (so as to not receive manifestos) text box for participants to add their specific info which gives surveyors better info in some cases. I recommend implementing such a text box for the "Other" option on survey questions, it will allow for more info for y'all and will not slow data processing too much (the textbox should have character limits, otherwise you will receive manifestos given the demographics of those who may take EA surveys, especially if they came from LessWrong).

Prizes! Like stickers

Allow my EA hub answers to be counted here so I'm not double answering things.

Include section on concerns about the movement and its leaders. Especially with options related to diversity, attitudes, misogyny.

maybe survey about people interested in devoting careers into generating/processing EA evidence

Consider using the LessWrong-survey as inspiration.

It was a very well-constructed survey!

STOP TRYING TO TRICK ME INTO CREATING A PROFILE

Atheism and agnosticism are far from being similar categories... Atheism is a belief, that there is no god; agnosticism is the knowledge of our own "ignorance".    I would welcome questions to the improvement of the EA movement, e. g. about decision making of the movement, transparency, the culture and the perception of the group, how the group treats low educated people, women, carnivores, criticism...

I'm not sure why the answers to these questions would be useful or interesting.

I pressed the previous button accidentally, and I lost all of my answers which was somewhat frustrating. It would be nice if my answers were saved, or everything was on one page.

One question asks what career path we "plan to" follow. This is aimed toward young people/students, which doesn't include everyone taking the survey.

Include more problems in the priorities:  Pollution is not even in the list, but is the FIRST global cause of death, and unsustainable production and consumption models, the first reason that it is the first cause of deaths and without any actions taken, things will get worse

A spreadsheet with numerical values that summarizes results would be helpful.

Give an obvious, up-front time estimate of how long it'll take to complete. And then get that under 5 minutes.

It is great as it is.  Maybe you should encourage local group leaders to share it?

Add consulting to the survey, or at least management consulting (an 80,000 Hours studied if not recommended career path)

Use score voting without an exclusive top choice -- that unnecessarily skews results.

I think this might be a good way to get feedback on projects/efforts, e.g. some of CEA's community work. That type of coordination to help with feedback and planning could be valuable.    I also think it could be worth considering linking up with local groups in hubs to add on a few location specific questions for similar reasons as above, though perhaps not depending on time/effort tradeoffs.

Have 'work for an EA: Org' option on the 'which industry do you work in' question.

More probing questions about beliefs and where they come from, to help uncover and address group-think, i.e. the disproportionate amount of EAs all "independently" - and wrongly! - coming to the conclusion that AI risk should be the biggest current concern, that climate change isn't urgent and only has a small chance of causing human extinction in our lifetimes, and that "most animal lives are net negative". Ugh.

Include the option to give permission to share (some) data with local groups (if it's linked to an individual person, not sure if it will be as I haven't given personal details yet).  Just pressed the back button to add that now I know you ask for personal details on the next page. Also â€“Â more feedback about the next page, I find it annoying to maintain both GWWC and the EA Hubs donation profiles so I've not maintained the EA Hubs one. I needed to check my GWWC account to find out exactly what I've done but the site is currently down.  Also, on the coaching question, I've not received coaching from 80k, but Ben did put me in touch with a couple of people after a random email chain that we had going... that was part of what led to my current career path.

Please add Taiwan (R.O.C) to your list of countries. I realise it hasn't come up on your list because many do not recognise it. However, it is not a political statement to do so. For all practical purposes it is its own country. I do not live in China.

awfully long

Estimulate more cause areas

US-centric race options

It's pretty long.

You asked for my projected 2018 donations but not for my projected 2018 salary. Iâ€™ll be around CHF 100,000.

Think more on what you're trying to achieve

for the religion question, the "other" option should have scope to explain. More space for explanations generally.  that way you'll learn more.  Numbers don't tell the whole story.

For political/religious direction, I'm not really sure what to answer (or what e.g. center left/right, the various diet options, and some others even actually mean). It seems difficult to properly categorize the relationships I have towards these topics. (My overall attitude can be summed up as "don't really care, but try to do the 'right' thing when it has low cost.")    However, if the questions have relevance it could be useful to have a text field next to "Other" like the question regarding diet did, to enable some elaboration.    Great survey though, I feel like it has improved over time and the feedback from previous years has been noted. I found it to be very time-efficient, and look forward to seeing the overall results. Thank you!

Memes

Seems thorough enough. Please share results with the public - I'm especially curious what others believe are causes to consider in the future.

Just a little thing, but in the question about political beliefs (left, center left, etc), you could somehow acknowledge that different countries and even continents operate on different scales (as in, have different ideas about where the center is). I answered as a European (picking center left), so if you assumed the American scale, you'll think I'm more to the right than I am. In America, I would be probably far left, believing in things like single payer healthcare, 15 dollar minimum wage, etc.

For my perspective it would make sense to not assume everyone has finished school, but that might be not applying only to a small percentage of the people taking this survey. Also for some people other languages might help, but I see the big effort that would take.

make it shorter

Mobile version tends to jump up the page when you hide the keyboard on my android phone. But I think that's a surveymonkey problem.

no suggestion..here to learn

As I suggested in 2017, briefly spell out the goals of Effective Altruism, and use the term "Effective Altruism" rather than just the initials.

The survey is fairly quantitative rather than qualitative, I suspect there are useful qualitative questions you could be asking regarding perceptions of different groups.

Allow multiple answers in the demographics section

Thank you to you & your colleagues for doing up the survey! And to whoever is reading this, thanks for going through people's comments and improving it for next year! You're awesome.    - I think it would be cool if you asked people if they go to an effort (and if so, to what extent do they go to an effort) to make the EA community welcoming (in addition to the question you already included asking if they find the EA community welcoming). Although I'd be a bit worried about the results, because although some people definitely try hard to make EA welcoming, there are definitely also people who don't see the creation of a welcoming atmosphere as a priority.     In Q17 it might be good to include animal welfare and animal rights as separate cause areas, because you could argue they are quite distinct from each other. I also didn't see any options representative of value spreading or moral circle expansion, but I realise that there aren't 80k profiles on those cause areas yet so I imagine that's why they haven't received as much attention as other cause areas.     - In the career plan question it would be great if you could give people the option to tick more than one box, or to write something else entirely. My career plan didn't fit into any one of the boxes, but I didn't want to click "none" because it was more like a bit of "all" rather than "none" of the options.    - I think it would be awesome if you asked people which organisation/s they volunteered for and for how long, rather than only asking how many hours per month they volunteer.     And again, to whoever is reading this, thanks again for doing what you're doing! Hope you stay awesome =)

There is no space for general comments about the EA movement, no demand for feedback on what EA organisations could be doing better (rather than just feedback on the survey itself), and the option choices in many questions seem oddly limited. Overall kind of a weird survey.     Also, it's a small thing, but the ethnicity question.. Come on, we're not all American! One box for Hawaiians and one for all Asians? None for mixed-race people? Given your (admittedly minor) focus on poverty, would you not be curious to know whether any people from low-income countries are joining the movement? (you should ask about origin not just current location.. many of us will be working in developing countries but actually from Europe or "the West")    One thing that's off putting about EA is the strong sense it's a community that is very happy to consist of two small clubs: a club of white boys in the Bay area and another club of white boys in Oxford. Now, you may disagree that that's the vibe you *want* to give, but let me tell you: that's the vibe you're giving.    This survey doesn't help, not only because of the US-centric questions, but also cause it just doesn't ask EA-sympathisers for any feedback. Do you think that you are doing nothing wrong? Do you even care?     So (answering the questions you didn't ask), I'll read the research, glance at the newsletter, donate effectively, think carefully about my career, be friends with the occasional non-sectarian EA that bumps into my life, but I really, really don't feel like going to the meetings or events or being closely involved in the "movement", because your movement gives a strong vibe of white-rich-boy exclusive with little appetite for self-reflection - not for me, thanks.

Perhaps it assumes more EA involvement than many responders have, e.g. those following SSC links.  10% is a pretty hardcore commitment from the start.    Also, it'd be interesting to be able to comment on why some areas should be lower priority.  e.g. mental health is important, but there's already a lot of money going into it.  It seems more useful to me to ensure that money is allocated better within that category.  or e.g. the meta concepts should probably be right at the top, but I don't know how much work has already been done there.    Also, the givingwhatwecan site is rubbish.  Chrome says it's loaded, but the pages are blank except a picture.  Then, five seconds later, text appears.

Just put a box for the city instead of the radio buttons.

more ideas for what causes have been suggested to be prioritized, as examples in the "other" section

- I liked the survey. Thanks for doing this!  - Change "EAF/FRI/REG/The Swiss Group" to "EAF/FRI/REG"  - I wasn't sure how to answer the "how much time do you volunteer for EA" question since I work for an EA org, but also do more hours than I would need to. This could be seen as regular overtime, or as volunteering. Not sure if this can be improved â€“ maybe add a "I work for an EA org" option to this question to simplify it?  - FYI, I took the TLYCS pledge two years before taking the GWWC pledge â€“ maybe this is not sufficiently relevant to ask for in the survey, though  - I wasn't sure which year to indicate for "when did you get involved with EA", since it was a gradual process in the beginning. I read Famine, Affluence and Morality in 2010 and took the TLYCS pledge right after, but there was no EA community back then. I got much more involved in 2012/13, when an actual community started to build. Maybe you can give a prompt so that people with a similar background know which criteria to base their answer on.

Its good ;)

Would be interesting to hear about people's motivations and reasons for engaging with EA, as well as the causal mechanisms (e.g. how they heard about it). Would also be interesting to hear about people's doubts / concerns about the EA movement as well as the EA philosophy.

By proving us with information most of the time and Products like the T-shirts and Visits.

You could include a question about mental health :)

My experience of this survey is that it was written by people with little experience of writing surveys.  The questions seemed like they were in an odd order. Also, some of the options were a bit odd too.  To lump agnostic in with atheist and non-religious is problematic. I don't think an option to write in your own religion was provided there either which I think is an oversight.

not sure

Maybe add more "Don't know/Don't understand" options. I found the question about political leanings hard to answer, but didn't know how to indicate that, so I left it unanswered.    Maybe it could also be nice to have a progress indicator, like a way for me to know how far along in the survey I am?

:)

excellent survey

Ask for general feedback to about EA as a movement?    Heres some short feedback: I think people I've met in EA meetings have far too much confidence in their ability to do good. I don't mean that people in general cannot do good, but rather that people individually underestimate how hard it is for them to excel at doing good.    One small illustration of this is that people call themselves "Effective Altruists", as if being a part of a group that WANTS to be effective at altruism necessarily makes you effective at altruism. Making a facebook group called "Profitable Businesspeople" and calling yourself a member of the Profitable Businesspeople movement doesn't make you profitable in business, and neither does being part of an Effective Altruism movement make you effective at altruism.     This should really be perfectly obvious, yet I too often see "EA's" congratulate each other and themselves simply for being part of this movement, rather than for actually achieving something valuable.    For example, some people promote the idea of funding  housing projects where EA's can live without having to work, so that they can focus on EA. I'm not against this idea IN PRINCIPLE, but the "Effective-Altruist implies effective altruist fallacy" causes some people to not focus on the obvious questions about this, such as: how exactly are we going to make sure that these people do effective work? The world is full of non-effective altruists already, so how do we make sure this housing project doesn't just become another collection of naive hippies that isn't disciplined by real world metrics? The fact that they call themselves Effective Altruists is close to zero information on this.    By the way, none of this criticism apllies to the serious people at CEA, 80k etc. It applies to the young stusents who go to EA meetings but haven't done anything really challenging in their life, and think they can just brainstorm some half-baked ideas, formatted in rationalist-sounding terminology like "Bayesian updating" and "optimization", and that makes them an "effective" altruist.    In summary, I am seeing early signs that this movement is letting people in too easily without slapping their naive and undiaciplined thinking out of them. My prediction: unless people in EA actively work against this process, it will continue to worsen in the near-term future and will waste some of the work that serious EA people have put in this.    (Don't mistake this answer as pessimism about EA though. I'm generally very positive about this movement: this is just a small concern)

Check concept is understood by giving example

The questions about careers give options of earning to give, doing research or working for a non profit as though those are the only options to be an effective altruist. Working for government, or in consulting, is also valid. Also you can both earn to give and work in an altruistic career - it's not necessarily one or the other.

No biggie, but check a little closer for typos. Otherwise, I think the actual substance of this thing is pretty good.

Include questions of why people stop being active in the community

In question 17, the choice "Meta charities which direct resources to these causes" appeared near the top of the list, below "nuclear" and "climate change". It was confusing whether "these causes" meant the preceding ones or all of the mentioned causes. I ended up assuming the order of the alternatives in Q17 was randomised and thus that "these causes" were all the causes in the list.    I remember it as being longer last year. In any case, it felt quick and easy to answer this year. Good job.

In case you find that EA forums feature enough lasting lurkers to render such considerations worthwhile -- include more questions or free-response text boxes which would allow newcomers and would-be EAs to share the extent to which they think they're "EA enough," or just EA-compatible in the first place. I have a continued interest in EA, but don't take the mere fact of my continued interest as a strong enough indication of worthiness to participate in EA alongside more sophisticated thinkers and writers. They and I seem to have similar intrinsically motivated interests, and somewhat similar personality traits, but that's just an educated guess. I don't want to pollute the forums with sophomoric output, and have erred toward extensive lurking partly due to ongoing uncertainty about whether or not I host or could cultivate demonstrable, recruitment-worthy, and steadily accessible comparative advantages which EA presently lacks.     I'm a credential-lacking, financially undistinguished autodidact whose past learning investments haven't matured into a concrete achievement one could identify, but would imagine that someone presenting such features wouldn't be summarily useless to EA if they had an EA-confined means to demonstrate their output-potential without the risk of polluting an already decent EA forum, and without the risk of bugging an EA with distracting novice inquiries.    The following finding from a 2015 EA survey is relevant to my proposal: "436 (37% of those who answered the question) said yes to â€˜Do insecurities about not being â€œEA enoughâ€ù sometimes prevent you from taking action or participating more in the EA community?"     https://eahub.org/sites/eahub.org/files/SurveyReport2015.pdf    I noticed that the "not feeling EA enough" question wasn't featured in this year's survey, and wonder whether that's because there simply aren't enough dilettante EAs left to learn about.

N/a

I would prefer it to be single-page

Explain what it is for.

I can't get to my donation history, all the sites seem to be down or have migrated, it's kind of a pain in the ass. I just put in roughly correct round numbers for this survey.

Ask what normative ethical theories they are and why

Perhaps more information on what you're looking to do with the information

Include a progress indicator

Too vague. Assumes we know terminology. Cities on menu represent a real liberal bias

Using typeform instead of surveymonkey could improve user experience.    Comments on specific Q's:  - 16: I find the EA community (un) welcoming to different degrees, depending on location (both on- and offline.) I think there are stark differences and it would be great to have more data on that + permit a more nuanced answer.  - 12: I want to say that I used to be involved and that I would be involved would I find my current EA group welcoming.   Specifically for "international people":  - 19: Being able to tick multiple ccy boxes would be great.  - 28: I live in multiple countries.  - 32: I hope you will calibrate the political beliefs answer to the residence country of the responded bc they can differ vastly b/w countries. More nuance could be good (e.g. fiscally conservative but socially liberal is sth I encounter often.)    Thanks everyone!!

It's a good length! Maybe ask how often people talk about EA, or how open they feel about discussing EA with various groups.

Progress bars are always appreciated

For Race, please donâ€™t put just â€œWhiteâ€ù or â€œBlack and African Americanâ€ù. There is a catagory for â€œAsianâ€ù and â€œhispanicâ€ù so why is it not all represented like this. White and Black are not races, they are skin colours. Words like Caucasian or Anglo Saxon, or European, or African, or... may be more appropriate.

You could add more opportunity for suggestions about how to improve the EA community.

Asking to evaluate new complex unknows : how many years people tend to stick to EA ?

Explain some key words, e.g. What is Cause Prioritization?  Allow more answers, e.g. I don't remember if I took the survey in 2017.  Allow an indication of how sure one is in each specific answer.

I don't remember why, but this ones is less frustrating than the one last year.

Ask people to give feedback about how the movement is doing, why they are more or less involved, what would cause them to become more involved, what things they like about the movement, what their vision for EA is, for the world, etc... More optional long form questions. (ask this question at the end of the survey)

Add 'Earth Science' to your list-a-ronie back there.

Give the opportunity for surveyors to talk about how long they have been involved with EA or heard of it, what they actually think of it (now versus when they first did).

The option for EA career plans includes direct work for a non-profit, but not direct work if it's at a for-profit, which is also a possibility if no non-profits exists in a given area.

I think it's pretty good.

Questions about what EAs think the community is and is not doing well

More comment boxes for "other" responses.

I actually don't remember if I did the survey last year, so answered no to be conservative.    For the is EA Welcoming questioning I answered how I perceived it before joining, and how I see others reacting to it/people talking about not wanting to talk to new people.    Slightly disappointed not to see any questions related to sexual harassment/assault after Kathy's efforts on that front.

For question 7 I wasn't sure how to interpret "get involved" (I don't currently have any commitments or serious involvement), and put in roughly the year I started reading & following the movement online.

For question 15. What broad career path are you planning to follow? -- add another category, uncertain. Especially bc there are a lot of young EAs.

reduce overlap in relationship question

In the "priorities" section, it wasn't clear to me whether it was "what should effective altruism prioritise?" or "what should humanity prioritise?". For example, nuclear security is very important, but I think it's already being tackled quite well, whereas climate change is super-important and I don't think we're doing nearly enough.    In short, I guess I wasn't sure whether to take account of neglectedness.

It would be nice if you could just pull the data about my donation history from my GWWC profile, especially since the move to effectivealtruism.org has made it more annoying to calculate the numbers since the totals are no longer available.

Love that you asked about diet. Curious to hear the results

I think you can add an "unsure" option for question 15 "What broad career path are you planning to follow?".

How would you express you were married and polyamorous? Also would be good to have more questions about community stuff, eg feeling welcome

Maybe more about career choices?

Ask us about our stage of life, kids future plans study etc

Are you in compliance with GDPR regulations? I hope you are bc I am providing  here a lot of info about myself :)

Perhaps include more political questions - I think a detailed breakdown in addition to the self-identified label would be interesting and potentially valuable.

Ask more about the atmosphere in the community- it can feel pretty incestuous!!

Provide options for employees to list more than one work area, some of us have two jobs in different industries (as in, we do non-profit direct work plus supplement income in the cooperate world)

It was fine although a little US-centric

I could not answer question 15. properlY

Add an EA-adjacent option to how you relate to the EA movement.

I said this in response to an earlier question: If you put 10% into a DAF years ago, from which you now make annual donations, it's not clear whether the DAF creation years ago should count or the annual donations from that now. To be consistent in comparing to annual income, it should probably be the former, but that's not how I think of our annual donations.    In the relationship question, "married" and "polyamorous" (and multiple relationships) are not mutually exclusive.

Move the EA-specific questions to the end so you don't scare off non-EA people.

Connect it to the SSC-survey

Just happy to get the results.

Crowd-source survey questions on the most popular EA forums.     Encourage independent local surveys, and request the results be forwarded to global.    Anonymize and publish the data! :D

I feel pretty bamboozled by this survey. I started making donations to 'Giving What We Can' because of my concerns about how effectively some charities were spending their money. My interests are in charities that support people, particularly in their mental and physical health and wellbeing.

Why do you want to know whether we are monogamous or polyamorous? ;-)

I was sometimes unclear when it was referring to "effective altruism" the set of ideological principles versus "effective altruism" the movement organized under that name.

Don't assume people are EAs

Turn relationship question into check boxes  Add "I don't remember" to question 39

(It is probably worth adding a "there is no local EA community" option, on the local EA community questions?)

I'm not sure if this was done, but based on the answers there could be a call to action (reach out for coaching for examples). Also, the list of cities to select "Where do you live" felt a bit weird, but I'm sure there is a reason for that question being set up as it was.

Count the answers

Put other on the religious denominations. I am aQuaker

Would be good to make this into a panel survey, following people over time. This would save some answers (like "how did you hear about EA and when") which probably get noisier over time with no new information. Would also enable seeing trends. Can be optional, of course. A good way to implement this is to have people e-mail themselves a unique ID with some code so it comes up in search later, then have them enter this unique ID in the survey every year and let them skip questions this way.

Add a "Not sure" option to question 39.

Make question about donations clearer - i.e. is it about all donations to charity or just to those which might be recommended by EA movement

Include stuff about ethical views (what theory of right action you subscribe to, what view of well-being you think is correct, etc.)

Perhaps split the diet question into two, I had a hard time with it.

You could ask about the impact of peoples jobs vs just their monetary donation levels. I do public health research - the job is impactful, but the pay is crap.

In terms of cost effectiveness (question on the next page), lives are never saved, just extended.

maybe some trollyology questions.

I do research on the psychology of effective altruism. Questions about the psychological characteristics of EAs seems really important and should probably be included.

0

Find a way for members who donâ€™t have enough resources to make significant monetary contributions to participate in EA.

Allow us to suggest what things might be bad with some things I've seen pushed by EA eg open borders and universal income

Provide incentive by entering participants in a raffle.

Show completion rate - I considered leaving the survey several times

Ask for commentary on how EA is doing in general.  I was very disappointed to be rejected from EA global.  Why do you have to limit the numbers in the conference?  Makes you seem very exclusive and ive blocked some communications from EA groups I used to enjoy following.

Put some sort of timeline at the top/bottom so people can see at which point you're at in the survey

Make it shorter

Make the survey more inclusive of people under the age of 18.

feelfree

Don't put the attention check on page one.  :)  Lots of potential small improvements to the survey, but generally it works well.

Shorter and less invasive.  Politics relegion and ethnicities are meaningless labels

Put Sydney on the cities list :(

An open-ended question or two, like something the EA community needs to work on or an x-risk for EA

More specific questions, where you can get an insight into how much people agree or disagree with certain EA concepts/arguments

You could ask about the charities people support with donations or volunteering

rather than "Other" as a gender option, self-reporting (fill-in) is more inclusive.

The question about religion should contain something like "pantheist" or "religious (no particular denomination)". I felt there was no option to represent my views. I believe in God but do not identify with any established religion. The "atheist / agnostic / non-religious" does not represent me either because I don't DISbelieve in God, neither am I agnostic about the existence of God. I guess in some sense I am "non-religious believer" but the worldview of someone like me is very different from that of an atheist, so that category is too broad.

Re: 39. Did you take the last survey, in 2017?    I'm not sure, but I think I probably missed it.

Less questions

Not have the survey time out if I stay on the same page for 10 minutes. Specifically, once I press the Next button it just redirects to the first page of the survey. Fortunately all pages (except the last I filled out) remember my answers.

Preset values for income / insert some plugin from Giving What We Can so that a person does not have to search for the values on another page.

I wanted to answer that my preferred career path is to continue to work in government to influence decision-making, but I felt that this was different than the option to work directly in a charity/nonprofit.  So I chose "earning to give" as my career path because my current government position does not largely impact EA causes.  However, by working in US government, my salary is lower than similar workers, so my earning to give capacity is lower than many in the EA world.

Include cis/trans/agender options for the gender question (for inclusion purposes.)

What happened to the question "Which cause would you like to see no EA resources go towards?"?

EA Forum should probably listed under 38, unless I'm blind

Be more clear one what to do about donations in various currencies on the donations bit.

provide a wider range of choices for causes to support.  Include things like biomedical research, climate engineering, anti-asteroid or other threats from space defense, anti-aging research, human augmentation research, fusion research, search for new worlds, and other big pay off research/ engineering projects.   I would recommend splitting out your question on reducing of "global warming" into multiple approaches:  reducing CO2 emissions, building nuclear power plants, and next-gen climate engineering (aerosols /CO2 sequestration/ etc.  People who are in favor of one approach are going to hate the others.

Ask questions about how we would like the EA movement to develop in the future. This question wasn't asked.

Question 13 was odd/confusing. Hearing about people's perceptions of problems w/in EA or threats to EA could be informative as well

multiple choice for income has the same result but feels less invasive.

Can you have one of the "Percentage complete" bars that increases as you go along?

Sleep better. Do more physical exercise. Smile more :-)

Ad a "I don't remember" opinion for question 39 - I am leaning for a "yes" but I am not quite sure. :)

I miss a progress bar

Either get rid of the "in a relationship (polyamorous)" category altogether or just make non-monogamy an extra tickbox (hint: you can be married and poly, and you can also be in a relationship but neither monogamous or polyamorous).    Add option for the "try pledging" bit of gwwc, as better info on the pipeline to a full pledge seems useful.

Ask about the extent of people's moral circle. Does it include non-human mammals, vertebrates, insects, mollusks, artificial intelligences, alien life forms

I think we should capture emotional and functional reasons, benefits for choosing EA, and also journey to becoming an EA for those who are - This would help you understand how market for more recruits and drive wider behaviour change

You do not talk about wealth (as opposed to income).  This is a general gap with EA campaigns, but is highly relevant for us baby boomers thinking about how much of our savings to pass on as inheritance or to donate.

There was no option for 80k career advice that was not wanting it, only yes, no but want it, or none of the above.    Also mild preference that probably doesn't matter, but there were a few questions where it would have made more sense for me to be able to click multiple things, such as atheist and Buddhist. Not that important though.     You didn't ask which causes the donations went to. As an EA, that's one of the survey results I'm most interested in.

*Concretize the political sympathies. Left/centre/right in relation to what?  * A calculator for ones income/donations might be helpful. Or a link to an appropriate tool.  *Perhaps change ethnicities? My gut feeling is screaming americocentric when I pick white.

Ask for criticisms of EA.

Relationship demographic question is ambiguous for people who are both married and polyamorous

I'd like to see more diversity in the EA movement. I'd like a post-survey analysis of where and how the diverse section of our movement came to learn about EA. I'd also like to see new questions in the survey that help to identify problems regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion that most of us might not notice or otherwise be unaware of.

It took me back to the beginning after finishing this question... not sure what happened. Also questions about EA's moral beleifs and whether they are considered unusual by their friends and family would be interesting.

you guys could provide some concrete example to see how people try to solve problmes

Ask more open-ended questions about how we'd like to get involved or why we are only involved at the level we currently are? Make the goals of the survey more clear at the outset. I'm not sure if this is more of a census or more to understand how to grow and be more effective.

Provide better options for the "Career" question - I work in software development, and it took me some time to figure out which answer choice best represented me.

Progress bar ;)

Better politics options

I don't remember if I took the survey last year

Randomly kill pseudorational white cis brodudes infecting the EA community

The religious option should let people check multiple choices. It says you can but currently you can't.

The survey was an appropriate length and asked straightforward answers. I don't think it needs improvement.

Make it even prettier and pay premium to lose the survey monkey branding.

Relationship status and poly identity separate.

You allow investigate more regarding what you might be doing incorrectly.  E.g., questions like "Why haven't you joined EA" (with option for detailed answer) or "What philosophy do you find more effective than EA for philanthropy" (and why)

I found the cause priority section really difficult to answer. Of course it is a difficult question, but it was also because it compares very differznr thinks. Maybe giving a little more context for less involved EA people would be good.

Under demographics for ethnicity, include an option or the option to add an ethnicity. I.e. I do not identify as Black or a part of the African American community; rather, I identify as African.

Differentiate nationality and country of residence. (I'm a UK citizen living in China, which means I'm statistically unrepresentative of my area)  Maybe ask about people's motivations for being involved in EA.

I wasn't clear whether to put my major or my current job specialty.  I put my major, though I am not a physicist.  I didn't see a place to put lifetime donations, but the next page is asking for it (edit: ah, but I'll leave it in cause it confused me).

Felt the survey was quick and good. Perhaps, additionally, there can be some reflective questions about what the respondent feels went well/poorly for EA in the past year, and what they would like to see for EA in the coming years.

On some of the "either/or" question you should maybe include an "other" option and a text box for an explanation. A few of these questions required me to choose a least incorrect answer. Great overall though!

Utilise conditional questions for more tailored segmentation of population.

Don't ask students which industry they work in?

ask more about the factors that led people to donate money/time

Add Sydney to the cities list :)  Australia does tax years from Jul-Jun (so struggling businesses don't have to get their tax done during the xmas rush)... which makes it slightly awkward to calculate taxable income during the calendar year instead... would it matter if you asked "last financial year" rather than last calendar year?

More free text to understand issues/ contradictions participants have with the movement which may be limiting growth...e.g for me, heavy focus on artificial intelligence, and uncertainty about potential harms of a course of action e.g donating to one charity e.g what are the effects of using insecticides on antimalarial nets...could we be doing more harms in future...

1. Less discrimination. When you ask someone for their country or city or currency, there should be a drop down menu for all options not just a couple from the Western world (That is less than half the population of the world have far lesser problems than say people in the Middle East or South Asia)   2. The developing world needs much more attention than this survey provides. I am not sure what audience did you have in mind when you guys were creating this but this is clearly meant for an upper-middle class white Western crowd. That is deplorable, considering especially that it is coming from people who are allegedly trying make the world a better place. Disappointing to say the least.  3. Should ask people about specific regions that they are interested in donating to in the world and why.  4. I understand that Public Policy is not your forte but still you can ask people if they would like to get involved in ti and to what degree and which areas etc.  5. Do not mind the critique, it is only meant to make things better. Thanks

Need to tighten up your sampling methodology; for me to reply via ACEâ€™s twitter post is convenience sampling =/

An early question asks "are you an effective altruist" but later questions assume the answer was "yes" rather than giving options that make sense if you answered "no".

It's good!

It would be great to know exactly why you are collecting this data

Not the *survey* itself, but make it a lot easier to look up my donations & income from past years. I was tracking this on My Giving on GWWC, but now the data has migrated to effectivealtruism.org, and in the process my income data has been lost, and apparently I'm not allowed to add income data starting more than a year in the past, and my donation data is not aggregated at all. This makes the donation numbers I've reported in this survey rough and imperfect.

Don't know. It's excellent as it is.

My income/donation questions may be misleading/misinterpreted since I started my first job in 2018.  I'm not sure whether it's worth adding a spot for "predicted income in 2018" or "2017 income divided by time employed" to alleviate this.

Fewer questions.

Cultural issues (e.g., inclusiveness, broadly construed) within EA are a perennial topic of discussion. Some questions about people's perceptions of EA culture might provide useful data.

The political spectrum question is unclear about what country's political climate is being used as a standard. For example, there are plenty of American center-leftists that would be seen as right-leaning from a European perspective.

Add options based on answers to previous surveys.

Better idea how far through you are. Maybe a progress bar?    I don't really like having it in sections, but the benefit from having your answers so far saved if you leave makes it worth it.    If this is the end, there are things you could have asked about but haven't along the lines of moral views. I would be interested to read summaries of this data, but worry that it might put people off answering. If this question isn't at the end, it should be. In either case it should be made clear whether there is more to come before asking this question (the button below just says "next").    Someone commented on facebook that this doesn't play nicely with the browser "back" button.

Replace "gender" with "sex".  The race/ethnicity categories are very US-centric. Split Asian into East/South Asian. Remove American Indian. Broaden Islander to Austronesian.  Ask for family religious background instead of or as well as religion.  Split Christian into Catholic/Protestant/Other. Add Chinese traditionalist. Remove Sikh. This better reflects  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations_by_number_of_members

Add Paris in the cities you propose ;)

All is good.

Provide alternatives for doing good other than money donations, for young people still studying it is not very easy to donate much, which might create a feeling of helplessness.

I don't like ticking a box that mixes atheists with agnostics - and I am surprised EA would blend the two.

Start the career title starting with "Telecommunications" with "Technology" so it is easier to find on the list.

It's absolutely optimal.

More open-ended questions to allow respondents to express more nuanced/detailed opinions on experience of EA

A few of the questions don't make as much sense if you work at an EA org. For example I don't volunteer I just work long hours at an EA org, I'm not part of a local group because I see a lot of EAs daily etc. That might not be worth fixing if we're not the majority but it could be interesting to get data on how many people work at an EA org and see if their answers different on any dimension.  I'd also be very interested to hear how people would describe effective altruism.

Ask more about positive a negative things about the community. Why do people want to be part, why are people driven away. Then optimize accordingly.    (In my case: driven away from the local student's chapter because of a very authoritarian, cultish and non-emotional-intelligent 'leader' of the chapter who wouldn't allow us to discuss philosophy and cause prio, but would rather just use us as his personal leafletting-for-EA-army. I still love the EA principles and ideas, I am just alienated by a part of the local community. So to optimize better: try to stay in contact with local groups and help them / correct them so they can be effective in finding and keeping new people)

There ought to be a clearer way to say â€œI donâ€™t know what my household income isâ€ù. I left those options blank without any explanation besides this one. It probably says a lot about how wellâ€êdesigned this survey is that I canâ€™t think of anything more substantial to put here, I almost always notice at least one big problem with every survey.

You ask about pre-tax income and then amount donated, but different countries have different tax rates. This will make it hard to calculate % of disposable income donated. Recommend you ask about post-tax income. Also question about how welcoming EA community - are you referring to local chapter or to community as a whole? Local community (Sydney) excellent, broader community insular and dogmatic.

show which page you are on in the survey

Give more space for open ended feedback? (I'm not sure if you really value this information, but if you posed open ended questions, I'm sure I and others would answer in detail.)

Incorporate anticapitalistic ideas. System Change not Clean Meat.

Ask more about inclusion and potential problem areas in the community

in mobile the cursor jumps sometimes, that sucks

Define "Effective Altruism". What am I signing on to by being interested in this group? Do you assume I;m not religious?  Is there a value-laden inference about what is "effective"?

The "which city do you live in" question presumes that anyone taking this lives in a city.  I know there is an other option - but maybe just ask: where do you live? It would feel less presumptuous.

optional justifications for why we chose the ranking for the priorities?

add "for profit direct work" as option in career path

Get better industry categories tailored to your audience (include professional services/consulting, social enterprises, entrepreneurship, international organizations, which are highly populated by EAs)

give people space to explain why certain causes should be top priority or not be a priority at all    also, break out "other x-risk"

Change household revenue to ranges and the amount given to the percentage values

The political delineations are confusing. (1) If you're a US citizen those delineations are going to mean different things than if you're European. (2) Most of the categories seem to be about social views rather than economic views, but libertarian also includes economic stances. It may be worth separating those or specifying that you're asking for stances on social issues only.

1 - Write-in option for the religion question. I'm an atheist but I also identify as Unitarian Universalist and I'd like to be able to write that in.  2 - Broader, less America-centric ethnicity options. (I, Bruno Parga, would be happy to talk more deeply about this with survey organizers.)

political orientation was single axis, so I didn't answer. would have preferred to say I'm libertarian liberal.    romantic situation did not include "poly, but no partners", my true answer.    there was no question about earning potential. my highest paying job so far was $161k/yr, but I left it early because the company sucked at management.

The career choices didn't seem very applicable to me; I want to both get involved in an organization that is doing good work and donate a large fraction of my money, but not optimize overwhelmingly for either

You break down existential risks into several sections, but leave global poverty as one. There are many elements of global poverty that EA's don't consider enough.

Superb time estimate. It took me 20 min and 19 seconds, and I take relatively long to complete surveys. Thanks so much for being honest about the time commitment required.

Ask how people want to contribute to the EA movement. In my case, I would like to get much more involved with the local group and would like to receive coaching.

I feel like "EA communication/outreach" should have been a separate option for career (since I would separate it from direct NGO work), but not sure

Clarify what's meant by the cause priorities question - is this what we personally can justify to ourselves based on our own opinions/beliefs, or what we genuinely believe to be true (which should be based on how what other more intelligent people think)? In other words, would it be ok to go straight to 80k and see how they prioritise the issues, and answer according to that?

It seems that at the end, there is no "Final submit"-button or something that says "Done!", but instead there is just another "Next" button that leads back to the first page with all answers still selected? That should be fixed.    Consequently, I'm not sure if you have now received by answers twice or not at all :/

status bar

Get info on who would like to get involved how, mistakes/ dangers for the community, what we value in EA, what we donâ€™t

This is a very tough survey to put together and I think you guys have done a great job.  All I would say is that there are too many questions which are too difficult to answer by checking a box.  Keep the 'factual' questions (e.g. age, income, groups that you are a part of, industry, etc.) and maybe try to hone the subjective questions so they give a more definitive answer.  The questions in which charities are the most important to you was impossible to answer correctly and if I had just read an article or seen a headline on one topic or the other I may well have changed my answers.

Publish more engaging visuals of the results.

kittens

Asking what city people live in is personal identifying information for people who are on the EA map and live in a city with few EAs. A person Mike comfortable with being on the map, but not want to share other information like salary. Asking what country, or state or province of a large country, might be better for write in answers.     If you're trying to match up the same people's results over time, bear in mind that things like religion and gender can change.

Ask people how to do a calculation using the basic EA formula to explain what they 'give' if they do , and to who or which charities,  and maybe 'why'. (Christians or other religious people--jews, muslims, hindus , bhuddists, may give to different groups than do Agnostics, Vegans may give to different causes than vegetarians or meat eaters,  enviromentalists may give to different causes than car drivers . )      Ask people to do the calculation . Show the numbers you use and the modified EA equation you use. (It has to be modified.)

Feels good this year _Ÿ˜€

send me a cookie,lol.

I am unsure how to put down Secular Jewish when that's not really a religion or a race, but it seems a significant enough population among socially relevant groups that it is worth statistically examining. Maybe make the religious beliefs option a multiple checkbox?

I think the survey is really good! :)  You ask if I donate money, but you did not specify if I a donated to EA-related orgs.   You ask me about my career path, but you did not let open a "Other" choice rather than the three you listed.

Clarification / elaboration on the cause prioritization question.

The Technology (or Software) sector is weirdly described in your business field pop-up. I had a hard time finding it.

Some of the demographic questions are ambiguous/non-exclusive. For example, married does not necessarily imply monogamous. For the religions, each can be interpreted as a set of moral injunctions, cultural practices, or cosmological beliefs, allowing almost any combination across the three aspects.

instead of using the proceeds of cognitive application to fund the EA movement, use the cognitive surplus of membership to generate IP for sale. This way there are absolutely no strings attached, see the neurocollective

Some sort of measure of how far through the survey I am.

Change some of the questions to reflect previous answers.

I'm guessing that you could ask for more data points: maybe there could be a compressed and expanded survey.

Focusing on actionable insights: including questions where the answers from the community could change how EA behaves.

An E-mailed summary of the results would be nice (can't remember if you already do this)

I would like to know more not only about current cause priorities, but also about what people consider their terminal values

If you could add some forecastable outcomes that surveyees could put probability estimates on we could see how likely the community thinks various outcomes are and how accurate the community is.

It seemed like a good, reliable and valid questionnaire.

This feels like a scam

more clarity on the period that the questions apply to: today I have finished my coursework and am about to graduate from my masters program. I plan to start work full-time in a couple weeks. I was not sure how to classify whether I was a student/worker/out of the labor force.

Send me an email to remind me to take it next year

Ask EAs whether they really can assess deeply or at least quickly and roughly scale, neglectedness, and solvability of a problem, or effectiveness of a proposed solution, project or organization. And if they can, how do they do it. I doubt there are many EAs who can do it reliably.

Add a box for general thoughts about the movement. I have snarky opinions I want to vomit into a textbox.

A couple more comment boxes such that there's one per topic

Could you use skip patterns to ensure students are not asked employment questions. Skip patterns would allow respondents to only answer questions relevant to you.

I noticed that my sense of cause prioritization isn't coherent at all. This isn't feedback on the survey, but its interesting to note that I don't know which cause is most important and I also don't care. I feel my impact will be in the future and I have time to decide.

add state/provinces & countries to the list of cities (for the Q about which city do you live in), since e.g. there are multiple Madison's, maybe multiples of some of the other listed cities, as well.

There were one or two questions that had options that all didn't apply precisely to me.  So perhaps include an "Other (please specify)" for those questions too (even though that may cause you more work)?

Ask about community of EA - it's effects on members, and what could be done to strengthen the community's bonds / encourage brave EA lifestyle and EA evangelism.

Question 17 may benefit from having an option between "I do not think this is a priority..." and "This cause deserves significant resources...", as It seems like quite a big leap between these two responses.     Maybe have "Low priority" as an intermediate, or change the phrasing of the first to "I think this is low priority, so should only receive some resources.".

ask about positive and negative experiences with EA and local groups

I don't know if you'll give me an option to have my answers sent to me, but that would be nice (would also increase likelihood I can answer Q39 next year...I can't remember if I took the survey last year and can't find a Thank You email indicating that I did).

Make it more accessible on the forums, we should have a shitposting page thatâ€™s more public than the current uber-serious all the time page I currently read through

The location bit was weird; I expected it to change the list of cities after specifying that I live in Canada, but it didn't, so I guessed that the "London" on the list was the London in the UK, and added London, ON as an "other", but it was a bit off-putting and confusing.

- I tried taking the survey in the last three years I think, and never finished because it was super stressful, in part because there were too many questions that required me to have strong opinions on difficult topics iirc. This year's survey was much less stressful, I don't know which things you changed, but good job  - cause priorization question: I would have liked an option for indicating that I (do not) think a cause is important, without having to do a ranking of all causes I deem important. ("not sure" might mean that, might also mean "I'm not sure if I support this cause at all", so that didn't help)  - politics question: Could have used a reference frame. Right/Center/Left as conceived in the US, Europe, ?

More introductory explanations of terms

I don't know who you are, or how you use this.

In the household income survey it wasn't entirely clear whether it was referring to monthly or annual income. In the UK most surveys ask for your annual income, and in other EU countries they tend to ask for monthly.

What I have put on "other" on some of the other questions may represent alternatives that should be there.

Ask for insights into donation decisions, maybe what percent of donation money goes to an EA organization vs non-EA.

Please show the number of questions/pages left.

Is that truly the end? Expected many more questions. This also would be 1000x more better if it were done scientifically, which it is not at all.

More rating answer choices to gauge the common trends

Ask why. Give options so that it continues to be measurable, but ask why people got involved, what they like, what they don't like.

## donation_plans_comment  ##



I was working in 2017 but am now entering into graduate school and not earning much money

We honour the 10% giving what we can pledge and will continue to do so.

Only giving 1% b/c currently a student

My plan is to donate 10% of my earning, but I am starting a little late.

Taking a modestly comfortable salary from a non-profit doing good work, rather than donating what I make from that non-profit.

Increase donation amount significantly once husband has permanent full time employment

There's a lot of money going around, I think I should be focusing on other stuff. If it fails, I'll go back to working as a programmer and donating a big portion of my salary. I still pay for accommodation and favours by donating to charities that fellow EAs choose.

My interest in EA coincides with a major income drop in our household for 2017 so rather than giving more this year my goal is to set ourselves up to give more in future years.

I plan to take the Giving What We Can pledge when I graduate

To take advantage of tax law changes, I donated three years worth of donations in 2017 to a DAF and am spreading out the donations to charities accordingly.

The donations I provided above were primarily to a personal EA project I was working on. As long as it remains active, I plan to continue to fund that.

my plan is 10% of after-tax income

I plan to donate more once I have savings

At this moment I don't have money to spare, but I hope I will can help in the future.

Used to use an employer matching scheme.  Changed jobs and am struggling to choose what to donate to.   Wanted to sign up for the give directly uni experiments, but doesn't really work in GBP :-(

I plan to increase my main donations in line with inflation most years.  I give around 70% of my monthly donation to an EA charity and most of the the remainder to MSF

I'm starting to work full-time this year (in August), thus the increase in donations

the majority of my current donation plans involve devoting my time, my talents and communication to my network of like-minded friends.

I am currently a student.

I donate food in the barrio of San Jose del Cabo Mexico to feed about 25 families for a week and I bring about 50 lbs of clothing to them

Hope to increase donations while exiting poverty level (for family size)

This year I will not donate any further money, since my career change might require me to safe it.  I have not given deep thought to the question how much I want to donate later in life. But conditional on my income being "normal" in the future for my level of education, it will certainly be at least 10%

I used to be a hedge fund trader in 2014-2016 and donated quite a bit more. I'm currently starting work at a developmental practice masters program at Berkeley, if I enjoy that a lot I plan on getting my PHD in Economics to contribute with research or at an EA group.

I plan to donate at least 10% of my money as I earn it, probably pushing that percentage upwards over time.

I have pledged 25% of my after-tax income, and when I am finished with my education I plan to give away all income above the poverty treshold in Norway (about 200.000 NOK).

I only make a donation once a year. This is more comfortable

I support also Vipassana organisation... which is focused on peace and harmony...

My partner is supportive of the idea long term, but wants us to save for retirement, pay our mortgage, etc in the near term. I want to donate more of my own personal discretionary money but I suck at budgeting. With our jobs and young child, a lot of discretionary $ goes to daily life conveniences (eating out, parking). I want to do better!

Hoping to donate >90% of my lifelong income, but balancing the timing of that vs reinvesting in my business is tricky...

I want to make a difference by directly giving energy, motivation, enthusiasm and inspiration for a cause I want to support. I want to create hands-on impact. I want to be directly involved in social value creation. I see this as a major donation of resources available to me. My purpose in life is to help develop consciousness.

currently still on student/1% mode. going to ramp that up over my career until it's greater than 10%, in order to make it equivalent to donating 10% of my lifetime income.

Though I haven't taken the GWWC pledge, I am aiming for 10% as a personal benchmark. 2017 recipients were AMF, GFI, Rethink Charity. Future recipients will likely include GiveDirectly and StrongMinds.

Projected income in 2018: EUR 52000. My current goal is to become income-independent before reaching the age of 29 (by 2024), then pivot, possibly focusing on independent research.

I was unemployed for the first half of 2017 and now have a stable job. I am not counting employer matching in 23 above, which would double my contribution.

10%

Want to fund neglected projects, not big orgs.

I plan to donate after I start working. Currently, I prefer to use my money for career-building purposes.

currently unemployed

I'm interested in philanthropic investments that aren't strictly donations -- eg invests in social businesses or impact funds with potentially lower return

I want to get into Public Policy and fix that or at least try to because I feel like it needs fixing more than any other thing. Especially in countries like my own. Public Policy effects the entire spectrum of a society and therefore it has the most potential to mitigate all the causes that are worthwhile. My charity is that I want to spend my life, all my time, doing that. Please get back to me on what you think about this at mshahrukhhaider@gmail.com

I am increasingly thinking about investing an ddonating at a later point in time due to uncertainty or even dissaproval about currently available donation options.

i will try to give everythink over ~12000â‚¬

Student. Aim for 2% of Stipend ~ 200

I target 25% of gross income per year

Plan to give ~10%.

I will start donating again after paying off my student loan.

I plan to donate 10% of my lifetime income. However, this proportion is likely to increase as my career progresses. As soon as my income hits a certain level, I will cap it (I'm in the process of deciding what this level will be).

i plan to start donating after i complete my studies in a year or two, as my income will then significantly increase (currently in the lowest decile for my country)

Iâ€™m donating 10% of the money Iâ€™m spending. The rest is being invested, and I plan to donate 10% of that (hopefully larger sum) over time as I withdraw it

I received a substantial inheritance in 2016. I am a war tax resister  and refused to pay US federal income taxes because of the amount that goes to fund the military. I will have donated substantially more than my tax liability over a four-year period of 2016-2019

I donate 5 a month to tropical worms relief. I'm a broke college student, so that's about all I can give.

I'm a student

Schiller Institut, for the time being. Earlier I was focussing on reducing animal suffering and development aid

I'm too crazy^wdisabled^wautistic to function as a working person at this time, so I can't particularly make any contributions of my own.

I have a particular interest in health care economics, delivery and parity on the macro and micro scales.

I'm an entrepreneur, so give 3000 to be at around 10%, also took founders pledge

2018 donations are mainly EA Hotel in Blackpool. Want to keep up GWWC pledge at minimum (10% of profit cashed out from investments), also considering "donating now vs later" in terms of balancing future investment gains and the haste consideration, but not come to any firm conclusions yet.

I have donated time

When I have a steady income that is enough to support my life I will likely take the giving pledge, but I mainly expect to contribute with research

The figures I have put here run from October - October, since that is how my giving is tracked on My Giving. But I expect the numbers to roughly map to January - January.

I'm a college student. I plan on donating 10% or more of my income once I get a full time job.

10% of pre-tax income baby

I'm currently in school, but once I being a steady career, I plan on donating significantly more.

Worried about my own value drift, but still counting on my future self to be much wiser and choose more effective donation plan.

I have substantial savings and I plan to donate almost everything I don't consume during my life to EA causes. I try to live somewhat modestly to maximize lifetime donations. I won't have kids, in part for EA reasons.

10% Giving what we can pledge

Certainly at least 10% to the most effective causes

Donations should skyrocket if I can just find a job.

This year we might not be able to donate much due to life status and career change, but we'll rejoin the next year for sure

I am planning to take the Giving What We Can Pledge by the beginning of 2019. Due to personal circumstances, I don't feel like I could currently commit to giving 10%

I donate to Citizens Climate Lobby and USC Wrigley Institute  (sustainable solutions)

Currently saving money for a masters degree, hence not donating this year.

Currently: Student --> 1%  Later in career: probably >=10% (depending on enough income/ too much income; size of family; ...)

I am saving money right now to be able to maybe switch careers.

Plan to donate 20% of income annually by 2025

I invest to donate later, I have a very small discount for future lives.

Iâ€™m currently in a PhD - I plan to donate at a higher rate when I enter the workforce for real.

I am a grad student and I expect my earnings to rise significantly after I finish my PhD. My household saves a large fraction of its income and I anticipate that we will give significantly more in the future.

Currently much more involved with spending my time and pursuing priority career paths.

1000 dollar donation matching by employer in 2018

Once I have a career and am financially stable, I plan to donate significantly (>10%)

Bonus and Army Reserve work don't flow through GAYE, always give at least 10% of primary salary.

My current donations are symbolic. I plan to invest my income over my lifetime and pay off a mortgage as soon as possible, and then donate a significant part of my wealth at the end of my life. I believe that due to compound interest and minimisation of interest payments on the mortgage, that will maximise my lifetime donations.

leaving school to start work

One problem for me is knowing if I can have tax deduction by giving to a foreign country organization.

I am currently a student so have no significant personal income, the amount I did earn last year was from government scholarships.

Currently building a financial runway, so my donation amount is lower than I would like it to be. In future years, I plan to donate all resources above the level I need to live a frugal, comfortable/productive lifestyle wherever I'm living.

I will be donating more when I have paid off my student loans and have job security

I cannot donate in the near term, because cash availability and runway maximization are the most important financially, as an entrepreneur.

I decided early to safe money now and donate once I have my PhD and a permanent job.

When working for EA orgs it seems better to keep your salary low than to donate it

10% of my gross salary

Once I enter the workforce I plan on attempting to determine EA-adjacent donating to local entities as well; e.g. contacting schools nearby and buying classroom supplies.

Iâ€™m a student so Iâ€™m prioritizing paying off student loans right now

I have taken the pledge, but I'm still an undergraduate student

I am currently a student going to graduate school next year. I am working AI research. I plan to donate at least 10% in the long run, although I currently don't have much income

GWWC 10% pledge. 2018 backfilling for 2017 shortfall

Plan to increase over time

I'm in student mode

I am currently earning very little, because I am a PhD student and also supporting my fiance who is studying, but I intend to donate at least 10% of my income once I have a steady job. Ideally, I would like to donate everything above a certain threshold once we both have stable jobs.

Right now we don't have "real" jobs & are living off of stock dividends, so what we do is donate 10% of what we spent during the year, which usually ends up being 10% of 60-70K, which is close enough to my previous salary that it works for us for now. Not sure what our lifetime plans will be though; depends on how our income changes.

increasing over time, as I progress further in my career

I plan to shift my career path towards research helping EA causes

2017 was a high-income year so I donated about 2-3 times what I expect to normally donate long term

I hope to donate everything above a basic level to support my household (will be determined based on location), however I believe it is most effective to prioritize paying off my loans first.

10% of earnings at least

I intend to donate at least half of my income.

My family donates about 10% of pre-tax income, but does not include stock options in the "income" category.

I plan to invest most of my available income after saving for retirement into business projects, and donate the bulk of my money from my will.

I work at Optimum Pareto Foundation at graph based collective intelligence amplification tool in Poland and we want to help EA community to navigate coordination problems.

Current plan is to first get rich then donate

starting with donating 1 % of my salary (salary has reduced to 25,000 in 2018) Will aim to slowly increase to 10% of my income

I do not plan to give away any money

Saving up for a housing deposit, once I have that dealt with and a steady income stream other than student loans, up go the donations.

I've been holding off on donating for the past couple of years, in 2016 because I made too little to receive a tax deduction (and figured I could donate it later and do so) and in 2017 because my job was in flux so income source unstable. I expect to secure a stable source of income this year so I'll donate 10% of my 2016-2018 incomes.

I contribute to UNICEF Vaccination programmes and Wateraid. I am retired, living on a small pension. I feel these 2 causes are worthy.

2017 donations reported at our household level, not individual, because my wife and I decide donatons together and file taxes jointly.

I plan to donate only for charities seeking reducing exploited animal suffering and wild animal suffering.

I intend to donate all the money I am given as a gift for christmas, and birthday presents.

I am currently a student on a tight budget (1% mode). When I am working full-time, I intend to stick to at least 10%.

I stopped working in the financial services sector in 2013 (at age 55) in order to concentrate on charity work. This means I now have a very low income. I considered working to give but I thought direct work for the causes would be more effective.

If I had more money I'd give most of it to the far-future fund.

If I'm ever not completely poor, I'd like to give more to AMF and Give Directly, but I don't see that changing.

My partner currently puts much more effort in to managing our finances than I do. We both try to save as much as possible and are fairly frugal with money. We have spoken a lot about donations and make some donations now and also ask people to make donations for us instead of giving us presents on special occasions. We don't have any regular donations set up at the moment though. My partner in particular would like to first make sure we are financially secure and rather intends to make large donations later. We know the benefits of donating now as opposed to waiting but somehow still haven't totally changed our donation pattern.

I'm currently a student and I will donate more if I would have a stable income

Not donating in 2018 for tax reasons (only paid from October, will be taxed at the $30,000 bracket).

Making 55000 this year, and once midterms are over I will put at least 50 per month toward EA. I have donated 100 so far. One day I want to take the pledge but I'm not there yet.

Waiting for matching opportunities. Investing in the meantime.

We are at present owner building our house and have no spare funds for donation , and haven't for the past 2.5 years. Once the build is finished and we are in, I hope to be more involved with charity organizations and we can also reassess our finances as to what we can donate and to where.

I was working shift work before but now have a steadier income and can plan donations better

I would like to donate 20% of my income after I have attained a stable career and income

Ten percent is feeling good right now but I would like to give more in the future.

Waiting to group donations in 2019 due to tax reform (will take standard deduction in 2018, itemize in 2019)

I took the pledge, but currently am not motivated to donate anymore. Happy to get convinced otherwise.

I try to live frugally with a goal for early financial independence. Once that is achieved (hopefully within 10 years), I aim to donate the vast majority of my remaining income.

I am in a career-shifting phase and am not currently in a position to donate, but plan to do so once I have an established position.

Immigrant student, no money to donate

Iâ€™m currently saving for graduate school tuition (I estimate a masters will be ~Â£40,000/year). Iâ€™ve decided to save as much as I can now, so I donâ€™t have to borrow as much for tuition, so Iâ€™ll have less interest to pay and more money to donate after graduation.

Supported by EA money, making substantial donations odd.

Currently starting a company so had to cut back. Me and my wife plan to donate most of our wealth throughout our lives beyond enough for a comfortable modest lifestyle.

I'm currently in college, but plan to donate at least 10% of my earnings once I have a stable job.

I'm currently studying a 1-yr course and will need to 'recoup my losses' in the final few months of this year. I'm expecting to continue donating >=10% from beginning 2019.

I have pledged to donate 10%

Currently a student , plan to build up a stock portfolio to cover my basic need then donate the majority of my income

Planning to donate once I reach an income level that allows me to live reasonably well in the Bay area

In 2017 I was a masters student and I am now doing a PhD with a stipend. Both years I donated 10% and I intend to keep doing so.

I'm still just a student so I'm not sure I should answer those

I work full time for an EA organisation and my salary is too low to donate anything

Increase to 20% of income when investments fund expenses

As I am a student, I currently do not focus on giving.

If it's not apparent from the figures stated above, I'm currently in full-time (and very expensive) education. I plan to re-evaluate my donation plans when I'm in paid employment.

Was studying in 2017, now employed.

Soon to get inheritance, plan to donate.

I plan to donate at least 10% of my significant capital gains in addition to a percentage of my income, but I'm still unsure about the details (I only recently acquired some wealth that I invested in stocks/ETFs).

I've pledged 10% of my future income to the EA funds. Depending on how my career goes I'd be interested in increasing the percentage donated and / or donating lump sums.

I give tithes to church, so this amount corresponds to the amount I give to my church and affiliated organisations.

I don't have much individual decision over how I spend money while I'm supported by my parents in school; after school I'll begin donating from my job income and eventually my inheritance (my parents aren't EAs)

I do donation batching; gave ~2x in 2016, none in 2017

Intending to save, invest, and donate savings at end of life.

I'm planning to donate my life savings, over ~30 years, and I have a living trust so my estate goes to EA causes.

currently a student, plan to donate more once graduated and on higher income

I am a PhD student now, so have less income to donate

I would like to donate more when I won't be financially dependant on my parents anymore

I am still working this out. Although I recognise the benefit of giving to smaller, effective charities, we have for many years had a commitment to a number of charities with which we have a connection, and it is not easy to make a transition, particularly in the context of giving from a joint account. It is also more effective to ask my husband to give frim our account so the charities can claim the  gift-aid, whereas I am not a tax payer, and not currently able to work full time, which brings in another complication. I am still trying to work things out.

Military, giving what I can

I am a minor and still in college. I do not have the financial independence to donate, and do not often have the time to volunteer.

I can't donate until I'm financially secure

maintain at 10,000 for the next 2-3 years then escalate as my resources increase.  Have established my own charitable trust with the greater good foundation in Canberra into which I direct some of my donations; it makes distributions each year to nominated charities, giving me some control and ability to change priorities over time.  I also diversify my donations, there is considerable focus on overseas poverty/medical needs/curing or preventing blindness, but also some directed to environmental and mental health issues, and to preventing alcohol-related harm.  I also diversify by donating my time, i.e. volunteering with a telephone crisis support service with an ongoing shortage of volunteers, thereby directly preventing suicides, and I think I am much better than average at this work. I am trying to instill the need to help others in my son.  To further diversify, I also donated sperm at a clinic as altruism is often inherited, leading to one further child so far.

Until i lose faith in the my ability to design some radically helpful tech, not a foreign cent will be spent against global poverty.  Might need that money for my designs.

I would like to use EA as a mechanism but have found the doctrine inconsistent and have found the local Seattle EA group unresponsive to questions and gatherings outside of downtown Seattle

I note that I'm currently an undergraduate, so I intend to donate 10+% once I am either working or on a PhD stipend

I'm a student, my income varies greatly from year to year and will increase dramatically but I plan on always donating 10%

I work at an EA org.

I'm currently a graduate student. We are aggressively paying down loans (before they begin to accrue interest). Once I graduate and get a job, we plan live off of one salary and donate about 2/3 of the other.

My aim is to give away all my life savings to effective charities when I die except the equivalent of the 2005 value of one million SEK each to my childreen.

Planning to donate 10% -- 20% for life.

I am not financially stable and therefore have not been able to commit to donations

I'm planning a transition from a low paid academic training position; I am keen on setting a realistic plan once I do become financially stable.

Income above is for 5 months only

I counterfactually donate by doing low paid direct EA work

As a college student, my net income is currently negative, so I currently give in small amounts mostly just to build a habit. I expect to give much more in the future.

I don't want to answer

10% of my earnings annually

Building up savings and might look into investing before I start donating

Plan to re-prioritize my giving in the next few months, especially to consider donating to the EA meta-charities.

pass

I'm at an early, pre-revenue stage of building a business, so funds have been scarce. When the venture succeeds, my donations will also increase significantly.

10% of my post-tax individual income

Most of the money I don't donate goes into savings... which will highly likely be donated in the future.

Expect income to go up in 2018 hence increasing donations.

I nerd to be more financially secure before I can consistently donate, but I certainly wish to.

Because I might be transitioning work and I am currently working for an organization that isn't well connected with effective charities, I'm having trouble finding worthwhile organizations in which to donate.

10% of income before tax

Once I am financially independent (and not a student), I will donate at least 10% of my income to aging research foundations

I took the One for the World Giving Pledge.

I signed the giving what we can pledge and plan to donate 10% of my pre tax income. However once I reach about 50k I plan to donate any excess 50/50. If I ever reach a high enough savings level (undecided) I aim to donate 100% of my earnings over 50k.

I need to find a job and develop my career further before I consider causes to donate time and money towards.

In the future I would like to earn to give

I'm a student now, so I don't have that much resources. When I start working I will increase the relativ amount to at least the 10% of the giving pledge

I am poor and don't really have my life in order. So, instead of donating, I just feel bad about not donating, which I'm sure is just as helpful.

Took 10% pledge. About to start PhD, will drop back to 5% and pick back up once restart fulltime work

I prefer to use crowd lending and would like to move into impact investment or similar  So it's not donating, but..

I'm currently earning-to-save so that I can later switch to direct work when the time is right.

In 2017 I donated to AMF. In 2018 I will either donate to either AMF of SENS.

I hope to eventually give everything I earn over $35,000 a year

For me, financial priority is paying the mortgage ahead of time so my partner feels financially stable. After that, I plan to donate at least 20% of my income to EA. Instead of donating I might invest in my education so I can switch career and start working in EA (e.g. taking a sabbatical, paying for education)

I plan to donate a fixed percentage of my (income - expenses) so that I am motivated not to consume unnecessary resources.

More to EA

I am currently a graduate student living with a limited income, but have made plans to leave this year and will start a new career, where I can give at least 10% of my pre-tax income (via Giving What We Can pledge).

My current financial goal is to build wealth to generate passive income and reach financial independence. I consider donating part of my wealth at my death.

I plan do donate 10% of my *post tax* (not pre tax like stated in the pledge) earned income (not including gifts or capital gains) for much of my life unless my income goes up drastically in which case I will up the percentage. At my last job the percentage was closer to %20 because I was making a lot more

>10% of lifetime earnings

Once I have a full time job, I'd like to donate everything above roughly Â£20,000

Currently a student so donating over 1%, will graduate this year and intend to up to 10%

I plan to increase the amount donated in the next couple of years (and further).

I pledged 5% of my annual salary, which fluctuates from year to year unfortunately.

These numbers are messy - a small amount on my personal income tax forms, a much larger amount through companies I control.

Plan to donate more than 10% of lifetime income, but have been stuck near 10% for now while growing business and raising family.

Once I have a stable career, I plan to donate at least 10% of my income

Have taken the further pledge, where I donate everything over $25,000 individually. Mostly work for a charity, so take a much lower than market rate salary instead of donating.

I plan to donate the most when I retire. I'm focusing on saving now (in shares), and paying off mortgage. My lifetime goal is to donate at least 50% of the wealth I have when I die to EA (I'll do this by taking into account donations made during my lifetime & making adjustments in my will to reach the 50%+ mark).

I would like to donate, but I currently do not have the income to support doing so.

I'm currently Doing a further Education which is expensive. I Plan to Sonate in the Longer Term (2-4 years).

Me and My wife, have given  50% of my tax return Adjusted Gross Income earnings, the last 3 yrs. We plan to continue, unless we come up with a better plan - and believe like warren buffet - i can capital allocate better than the market and the power of compounding is better.  However I am uncertain what we should do with the other 50% of our earnings - i try to spend reasonably -as it is context dependant vs. the area we live in - so I feel guilty at times using those funds also.  When we die to hope to leave our children little, and donate nearly all  of it.

Planning to start a monthly recurring donation at 2-3% and gradually ramp up to 10%. I will likely earn less this year than last.

I am currently a student and give 10%, but hope it can be more once I have a job with a higher salary.

I hope when I am not paying >50% of my income on rent to take the Giving What We Can pledge but for right now, what I can give is... essentially stuff I free up here and there.

Because of financial instability and laziness, I didn't donate between 29 Oct 2016 and 13 May 2018. On May 13 I donated a little more than 10% of my earnings for the period I missed. I plan to donate 10% of my earnings monthly from here on out.

I am currently a college student- household income is entirely attributable to my parents. I plan to work in finance and donate 15-25% of my pre-tax income to charity on a progressive basis. (I might reevaluate if I end up really ridiculously wealthy or struggling to make ends meet.)

I don't have a proper income at the moment (student) - but have received substantial amounts of money from other sources (grandparents, maturing bonds, etc). Hence  it's unclear what percentage of my income I'm donating because my income is somewhat fluid.

Currently giving 2% and working part time whilst University student. Plan to give >10% when leave university and working full time.

I have taken the GWWC pledge (10%) and plan to stick to it.  I have no plans beyond that, though if our wealth / incomes increase far beyond current levels we may need to revisit this ... though partly the 10% was a choice that was deliberately going to be harder earlier and easier later in life.

Give fortune to charity after death.

In the long term I hope to be in a position to donate more and more. I am trying to get my own finances healthier in part so I know more accurately how much I can afford to donate.

I have just started my career and currently plan to donate approximately 5% of my post-tax income. In the future I consider increasing that to 10% or more.

10% founders pledge

I am a student and currently not making any significant income. But when I do make some eventually I plan to budget my spendings around my donation plans.

I'm a student and thus rather broke, hense the low numbers. Money is going into my education which will allow me to earn to give with my econ degree. Technically if one counts that then I'm donating upwards of 15k a year.

Because of the disruption of moving countries I have not had enough cash flow to keep up my donations. I'm hoping to build up a little runway in dollars before resuming donations, but I aim to donate 10% of my earnings from then.

I'm starting grad school. In the long term, I plan on donating significantly more each year.

Due to tax law changes, I am using a "bunching deductions" strategy of only donating in odd-numbered years, taking the standard deduction in even-numbered years. I anticipate donating around $35k in 2019, for an average of $17.5k/year

Will probably restrict to one or two charities in the future

50%

Currently at about 7% donation rate. I'm seeking to increase this over the years to at least 10%. Having children may thwart my increases temporarily, but I'm looking to at least remain steady at 7%,

I have inquired about career coaching from the effective altruism foundation in Berlin in order to improve my "earning to give" potential as a software developer. I assume the have more detail-knowledge about the specific situation in Germany than 80000 hours.

Working at an ea org so sticking to 10%

Working to pay down debt and save up a runway before expanding donations

I'm currently a full time student donating $20 a month as I'm not employed. I started donating in December of 2017 and still am.

Hope to calculate a relatively meaningful amount with progressive income

I don't plan on making ETG my way to value so I haven't thought much about how much I wish to donate, but, over time, I expect to donate at least 10% of my income. However, I plan on doing direct work and therefore I don't expect to earn much.

More when I make more money!

Asking for wedding gifts to charity

I'm confused.  I don't know what to do.  This is a very complex topic and I haven't made enough of an effort to meet the right people.  It's hard when you have distractions such as moving from the UK to South Africa, mainly to pursue a more EA career path, look for a new job in a new career path, support your girlfriend through a transition, etc. Etc.  I will research this today and see who is closest to go and talk to but if someone is reading this and can offer direct advice and help on how to get more involved that would be awesome.  All I want from this life is to help my girlfriend stay happy and productive whilst having as big an impact as possible on improving happiness throughout the world by preserving nature and spreading education, housing and employment / purpose

I currently aim to be above 1 %, but will aim to be above 10 % or more when I start working full time.

Currently planning on donating everything over $30,000 Canadian

I took the pledge, but am currently not motivated to donate at all, because my own financial situation is not stable. I would love if someone changes my mind again. And I think advise on personal finance should be cared for  more in the EA community.

My partner and I retired early %2 and 55 yrs) and are now living off our savings, minimal income. I will probably return to some part time work, the pay will be donated. I can't use our joint savings as my partner will not donate, he is not altruistic. This is something I have to manage and one of the reasons I keep some of my finances separate.

I intentionally do not have a recurring donation, but rather I donate on a monthly basis so that I can force myself to stay engaged with donating.     I started out donating $30 a month, and have increased it each month, with the goal of continuing to increase at least until I reach 10%. However I see no particular reason to stop there, assuming financial feasibility.

Currently a student, so donation is not my priority, but building skills and networking is. I plan on donating a large portion (beyond 10%) of my income when i finish my undergraduate degree.

Expect to donate significant proportion of life income

I'm in College for the next four years where I will be donating very little. Afterwards I will start donating a significantly share of my income.

Emphasis on international charities

My work focused on changing the funding system to ensure money given to local charities who achieve results.  Our nation of 4.5m people has around 115k NFPs many of whom have their hand out.  There are few drivers for efficiency in the sector: what I like about EA (and have used in my work) is reviewing NFPs through a critical lens.

I'm living close to the poverty line in a modern western country and find it hard to spare money aside from that which covers my basic expenses. So I consider an alternative donation format like: Donate 10% of every money I make above â‚¬14,220  (the official poverty line)

$20 per month on givewell

have donated more locally recently

I am starting a masters in September so am unlikely to donate much if anything from Sept 18 to Sept 19

I plan to donate more in the future, when I am older and in a more financially sensible position to do so (and in a more mature position to judged the best causes to donate to). It's possible that I will change my mind and donate more earlier.

will take pledge once school is finished :U

I intend to give 10% of my earnings whenever I have a regular income as a baseline.

The donations I made last year were almost entirely from savings / personal funds I was always going to donate. Maybe it'd be wise to drop this result when calculating % of income donated figures? I'm not sure.

I intend to donate more when 1) I'm more certain where is best to give and 2) I have a larger income.

The largest beneficiary of my estate is a GiveWell-endorsed charity.

I'm planning to take the pledge as soon as I get a stable income (I've been studying and only worked very little)

I would rather volunteer / cap income than donate

Start donating some, but invest most of the money until I'm more confident of what the most important cause is.

I'm a broke student fuck answering this

I left my job in September of 2017, and am currently self employed. I plan on not donating any more money until my financial situation is secure, so the $5,000 figure is just an estimate.

Have Â£5,000 in savings then rachet up donation first to 10% then higher. When in employment. (September 2019)

Mostly using a Donor Directed Fund arrangement, and thus limited to giving cash to IRS-qualified charities.

(The disparity between my 2017 income and donations (i.e. that it is less than 10%) is due to an income source whose allocation to charity is organizationally nontrivial and not in my direct control; I plan to remedy this later this summer.)    Hoping to increase the percentage share of my donations post-college once I have a larger source of income.

Low giving level due to increased expenses due to move to new house and selling old house

Continuing to donate above 10 percent of income, more once I am richer.

It's more like impulse donations instead of regular donations. I spent 3000 in Jan 2016 and 1/3 of it was for a GiveWell organization.

I would need to get buy-in from my spouse for increased donations from what I'm already doing. I also have some concerns/questions myself. I'm interested in EA, but somewhat cautious.

I'll aim to do a lot more over time once the immediate needs of my family are taken care of.

I currently give $5 per month to GiveDirectly and I plan to increase that when I start earning income after graduating college

I like the EA movement in theory. I was initially interested in some of your career coaching posts.  I thought maybe they could help me.  But it was clear that the EA movement, at least the way you approach it, is only for the privileged. Some of the career suggestions were, like, Get a PhD from a top university.  Thanks, I'm currently checking my mailbox waiting for my Harvard grad school acceptance after graduating from a mediocre college with average grades. This movement is for those who do not need to work and yet have plenty of lifestyle choices.  Alienating and off-putting.

These figures are actually for the 2016 - 2017 and 2017 - 2018 academic years respectively, as these are the time periods I use for keeping track of donations.

My pretax income in 2018 is expected to be approximately $75000.

I'm currently a student so all the above numbers are a bit small

I'd love a framework for thinking about effective altruism and smart donations that acknowledges my substantial debt from medical school, with interest-accruing loans. I struggle to call myself EA despite being rather connected in the SF community, because my net worth is negative. (But I'm a "HENRY" - high earner not 'rich' yet - and I'd like to earn-to-give.)

I'll start donating once I get a paying job. I'm still an undergraduate.

Looking for a new job, so it all depends

Keep up my GWWC 10% pledge (and donate more when and if my income increases)

I plan to at least fulfil the GWWC Pledge of donating 10% of my income throughout my life. If I have a normal/decent income, I plan to donate significantly above that. However, lately I have updated towards donating my time and talent rather than money: Working for a charity, preferably EA organisation. If I go this route I would most likely earn less than in the regular job market and thus donate less money.

I need to ensure that I am financially secure before I can commit to effective charity donations and taking a GiveWell approach.

2018 income is 1/3 wages, 2/3 investment income. Plan to donate 90% over lifetime.

I work in evaluating the impact of charities and this has led me to seeking causes that are less popular and more local rather than donating to a cause from afar, particularly avoiding large charities who can afford very well paid fundraisers.  My time in supporting small charities and the signposting I can offer them is also much more valuable that the little I am able to donate.

While I am currently paying off debt, I dedicate a lot of time to local volunteer work. I plan to increase my financial giving annually, while decreasing the number of volunteer hours I commit to in favor of giving money and through my career.

I'm still figuring out my finances and plan to donate more in the future when I'm more settled and when I'm older and wiser. Also I might limit my donations this year to double them next year for the tax advantage â€”Â I haven't decided yet. If I did that, I would still donate at least 6000 this year.

Being altruistic is something I feel strongly about

I am finishing graduate school and will be starting a job grossing $160,000/year in 2019. I plan to give at least 10% after I've begun working.

I do not make much money now but I plan to begin setting aside donations once my AGI reaches 50,000 USD.

We have been giving away my husband's inheritance (appx 1 million) at the rate of about 50K yearly for the to maximize Gift Aid. We also bought a house with the inheritance money but donate a "mortgage" to EA causes which is why our yearly giving is on par with our HH income

Iâ€™m still at uni so fairly little spare income but already gave 1000 this year, thinking to double/ triple the amount throughout the year

I'm trying to do roughly 10% but not being very strict about it, and not comfortable with lifelong pledges.

Plan to give 10% over the long run once temporary liquidity constraints pass

Typically I donate $4,000 / year, but I doubled my 2017 donation in anticipation of not donating in 2018 in order to minimize my tax burden.

I'm using all of my money to improve my life situation, which will increase my future earning power. Probably gonna start donating in ~5 years, if we're still around by then

I am still in the process of choosing charities to donate to so my money can do the most good possible. As my income increases I plan to set aside more of my income for charity.

I'm still new to this, and ive only just graduated college and moved into my first career position. I would love to be more involved.

I donate 5% of my income to a charity and another 5% (usually a bit more) goes into a savings account that I intend to use for longer-term investments (e.g. buying a house).

Was a student in 2017, plans to donate 10%, haven't taken the pledge yet.

Writing that made me feel like a douchebag, but the plan is to pay down all of our debt, then increase the amount we give to EA.

I plan to hit 10% donation level for life, but have had high career uncertainty that's caused me to defer heavily to saving

Saving money to open my next business which I hope will have higher impact than the few hundred dollars I can afford now

Would like to work in the non-profit space later in my career.

Student! Donations made when possible.

Pivoting away from a donation focus because people say the EA community has plenty of funds already

Career plans are uncertain, so currently giving regularly at modest levels. Hope to feel secure in giving more generously in future

donate to specific nonprofits through my will.

I want to start donating when I start working

Gave 5% of net earnings since 2003.  Considering increase to 10% in a few years.

currently a student with no income, unsure of future earnings

about 1 % as long as I am a Student  at least 10 % as soon as I earn my own money

I want back to school, so I currently don't have a lot of money to spare.

I plan to own enough wealth to live comfortably and donate everything above that.   I plan on only doing work that is EA until I am unable to continue working.

At the moment, Iâ€™m donating 10% of my income. I definitely wonâ€™t be donating any less for the foreseeable future.

In the long run, I want to donate everything above a certain level of income that's enough for a decent life without much luxury

I'm currently working at a not for profit, donating 1% of my income.

Still absorbing the impact of US tax law changes on my situation

I anticipate earning significantly more this year, so I will likely donate significantly more.

Just finished up my degree and looking for jobs. I plan on giving as soon as I have more than barely enough money to support myself. I plan on giving about 10%, depending on my work/ wage

I work for an EA org and have chosen to take a low salary as a way of supporting the org (to which I would donate). One can interpret this as an indirect donation or volunteering of time.

I am currently a student receiving a grant and working part-time. I plan to increase my donation amount as soon as I get a full-time, graduate job and earn more.

increase donations if salary increases

Trying to pay off my house then plan to combine donating and investing money to make more money to donate

It's only money. My biggest donation is time - roughly 60 hours a week.

I want to give time more than money (and expect my salary to drop.)

Invest in career capital now and increase percentage of donations while climbing the career ladder

I'm from Myanmar currently living in New Zealand and I'm aware of plenty of people in need in Myanmar so I give directly to them when I can. I aim to continue giving, work hard to increase my capacity to give, and I'm in also in research so striving to produce valuable knowledge.

I am currently unemployed, supporting my wife and child, so survival needs trump charity FTM.

Living costs supported by family. Donating at ~1% until full-time employment.

I am saving up for graduate studies in the area of research in social intervention. Subsequently, I plan to donate at least 10% of my income

I've set up an automatic payment of 50$ a month and considered upping the amount.

Donated more than normal last year due to maximising tax benefit. Long term, I will probably donate roughly 15-20 percent of income.

Reduced pledge donations while paying off school debt. Increase to 10% when I stop paying interest on my loans.

I'm currently looking for a job, so my 2018 contribution depends on that.

Most of my donations are directed to local causes

10% of pre-tax income to GiveDirectly

Didnt take the 10% pledge as a student. Will start working now, so I plan to take it.

Student without money

If I choose to return to studies or start an project/organization, donations will likely be around 100 again. If not, around 3000.

I'm still highly uncertain about whether it is better for me to save money now so that I have a long runway to work with to try to figure out how to do valuable direct work with my time vs if I should just be donating a large percentage starting now.

I work at an EA charity so my salary is rather low and I thus 'donate' my time but not much money

Currently a student starting in consulting in september. Planning to ramp up donations over time, once I have a lifeline

At least 10%, though as income increases will not need excess income so this will probably increase.

I donate 5% of my pre-tax salary. If I'm ever self employed, I'll figure out a different system. I liquidated my stock options in 2017. My usual salary is 84k.

Personal

student not earning $

considering to give less in the future, to build up own local structures (but need a good plan first)

I am now pursuing a PhD, am not in a comfortable position to donate this year

While I am aware that this is not anywhere near my percentage goal, at the moment I spend most of my money on nessesary personal expenses, and I will try to introduce a 5% goal as soon as possible, and then move onto a 10% goal.

I plan to take the pledge after I've bought a new home - this year. I'm adapting the pledge to include a threshold - will give 10% of pre-tax income over Â£40k

I plan to start donating when I have finished my education and become financially independent.

Have decided to study medicine so am unlikely to have a job for the next 5 years

I'm hoping to possibly draw up a small business plan for experiential donation centers.

Already donated a kidney

I have a savings account labeled "donations" that I put a portion of my earnings into to be donated when my runway reaches a certain volume, or to be used and refilled later if my runway runs out.

I currently donate 10% of my income, and plan to keep doing so, but I haven't taken the pledge in case my priorities change in the meantime (starting a family, buying a house, etc.) Ideally I'd be able to do both, but it might not be my sole decision in the future.

As we are planning on having a family, financial goals have shifted. I plan on giving more of my time rather than money.

As soon as I pay off student debt. I will maximize my life time dollars to give to the most effective charities.

I currently plan to donate 15% of my income. This may increase in the future.

Donations are low in 2017 and 2018 because I front-loaded donations in previous years. I plan to donate more than 10% of my lifetime income.

I have not done well in my financial priorities reflecting my ethical convictions.  I have been moving over the last three years to put myself in a responsible position to do so,

Have heavy commitments.  As soon as able to achieve that then donations will increase

I'm investing a lot in the intentional community I'm a part of, as a measure of facilitating a viable model for better living. its going pretty well, but its not a worthwhile cause. its just what's close to my heart and the only way I can imagine living.

I am unsure about whether I will donate in future, but direct work seems more important to me.

I am living on disability but I gave what I can.

Very uncertain about whether donating this year or just sending money to DAF given current opportunities.

While income levels are very high in Switzerland, living costs are unfortunately too. I plan to increase my donations step-wise in the coming years to be able to save some money for potential continuing education.

Cryptocurrency giving

I feel squeezed by the rich

currently as a student have to focus on building up some financial independence and later on plan to donate much more of my returns on my investments which are also tax-deductible.

As I am just getting involved in EA, I am currently trying out the giving what we can pledge for one year. In the meanwhile, Iâ€™m studying more on the subject, mainly by reading books. I might take the full pledge afterwards.

I'm a student so I don't have extra money

Pursuing quant finance with the aim of ETG. Plan to donate at least 10% of income, possibly more if I become a high earner. Intend to leave the majority of assets to effective charities when I die.

(I'm counting both donations and expenses that have the same effect as a donation, i.e. effectively increasing the amount of money some charity has at their disposal, without technically/legally being donations.)

I donate at 10% of the previous year's income, as there is uncertainty year-to-year about bonus size.

I used to donate, but have been held back because of  http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.cz/2016/06/is-effective-altruism-fair-to-small.html

I plan to set a level above which I will give everything away, once I get a full-time job.

US tax code strongly incentivizes making one huge donation instead of regular donations.

I am a Jesus-follower, and for that reason I believe that giving is a primary way to follow his life example. I aim to decrease malnutrition, disease, and promote humanity's flourishing.

Since 2017, I have used Fidelity Charitable to donate appreciated securities without paying capital gains on the appreciation, and the values reported above are the full value of donated securities.

Full personal financial security is a priority for me.  When I will achieve that, I plan to donate more.

I am currently sutdying but plan to donate at least 10% more once I have an income

Starting a company, income varies year to year significantly. I expect 2018 to result in far higher income and, thus, donations

I plan to donate half of my money when I die to charities, and half to my loved ones. Subject to change depending on assets available.

have already donated roughly 14000, plan to give as much as possible in the future

I met my pledge in 2015 and 2016, but a combination of uncertainty about cause prioritisation and difficulty arranging tax effective giving meant a hiatus last year, but I'm on track to give double this year.

I plan to donate at least 10% for my whole life.

I would like to continually increase the percentage of my income that I donate.

GWWC pledger, but undecided how to take this forward given plans to work directly for EA organisations, thereby counterfactually "donating" money by taking a significant pay cut and by negotiating less strongly for higher salaries / voluntarily taking lower pay.

Plan to increase to 10% in the next 2 years

After switching to research I plan to donate ~10% yearly.

I currently donate $50 to GiveDirectly and $25 to the EA Long-Term Future Fund on a monthly basis.  I would like to increase these donations in the future, but my financial situation is currently uncertain.  I am planning a move to a different city, my significant other is finishing nursing school, I may need to buy or lease a car in the near future, and I still have significant student loans to pay off.  I also could benefit from saving up for a mortgage down payment in the next few years.    I would feel more comfortable donating more once I have secured a new job in a different city, my significant other starts her nursing career, and I construct a long-term debt payment plan.

I have not done this yet but I will change my will as we donâ€™t have children I want our money and property to go to a good cause when we pass away.

Iâ€™m struggling with ACE charities due to the funds often going to welfarist issues such as cafe-free eggs. I am now heavily involved in the Animal Justice Party and advocating at the political level. Iâ€™m interested to know if giving to the party would be effective.

1 % from now on

The donation in 2017 was mainly to set up Sentient Media, a journalism-focused animal advocacy group. That includes some money from other years, set aside in a DAF.

Donating off of post tax income.

I'd like to save enough capital to have the option to buy an apartment before I decide to donate the remaining.   I am currently not planning to have children and I would like to donate everything I own to EA-causes.

Working on my personal financial security (emergency fund/paying off debt). Planning on earning to give in the future with a higher paying job.

I am investing my time in an education company. I intend to donate the majority of the value I make from this company to EA causes.

Planning to give at least and likely more than 10% lifetime.

We aim for a donation of 20% of our household income (before taxes, insurance etc.)

In order to maximize the amount I can give over the span of my whole life, currently I am using the money I have to make more money, rather than donate right now. This is proving to be effective so far and I believe it is a good strategy. I plan to donate much more later.

Hard to do much more without abandoning any attempt to build a 'runway' in 80k's terms.

I will donate more when I have a stable job

I always plan to donate 10%. The reason the numbers go up in I only worked part of the year last year.

Lacking income to donate. Focusing on direct work in talent constrained areas.

Saving money and investing it to have more for donation down the line.

10% once I have stable income

Donations are not tax deductible in my country of residence, so I donate according to my after tax income. I also have the plan to donate a smaller amount of my income now that I do not earn that much to invest it instead and donate a larger percentage later in life.

I give to a mix of EA or efficient global charities and local / arts charities. I give time to local charities by volunteering on their boards.

Some of the charities I volunteer at require weekly donations (food etc) and I do not calculate the cost of this, merely donating what I think is adequate

Currently donate Â£5 a month to the RSPB, and give spare change here and there to street fundraisers/charity pots.

Plan to aim for 10% of income (not decided if pre-tax or post-tax; currently I don't pay tax). May increase or decrease depending on financial situation.

Not devoting much thinking to the issue right now, mostly saving to eventually give. So donating just for a bit of a diversification, in the simplest way: by picking something from the top recommended by givewell and/or other ea linked resources

I'm saving as an investment in myself rather than donating upfront.

My numbers are hard to explain. I technical have access to more resources, but legally I am not employed by the org I volunteer at (yet).    Furthermore, regarding 'donating, I mostly give it to high-impact individuals who need money, or to run community events. I count this as donating to effective things, it's money I don't get back.

The current plan is direct-work on AI safety

I would rather not share financial information, but I keep my GWWC pledge.

Slowly ramping up from ten percent of spend to ten percent of income

I was living in the US for less then a year (and before coming here my income was ~10 times less), so I still spend a lot of money on settling down here. I plan to donate few times more more in the future. Also, I donate solely to MIRI.

Full donation is matched by my employer -> 10500+10500

After finishing my studies, I'd like to pursue an earning to give career in medicine, both in clinics and research.

Currently a student. Additionally raised about $AU 2000 this year, I imagine about half was counterfactual.

I prescribe to the "Warren Buffet" theory of giving- give after you've invested and made a return on that investment. It does not appear to me that the "cost to save a life" (or any other EA metric) is growing as fast as historic stock market returns. Therefore, investing now makes more sense.     The amount I give now is a hedge/signal.

I donate to feel involved and to help get into the habit of giving money. As a student, I don't have a steady income and so I don't donate beyond that.

I hope to graduate soon and begin to donate >15K/yr

I don't donate money, I donate time

Getting married this year - still figuring out how to compromise with a less EA enthusiastic partner

I'm saving up for financial independence to do worry-free AI alignment research.

After doing some life-budgeting and plotting some career paths, I plan on pledging this year.  I plan on pledging 1% until I complete graduate school then 10% for the rest of my life (unless I enter some other scenario that would put the money to better use, e.g. a societally-beneficial startup).

due to traveling and unemployment my donations and income were both smaller than i would like for 2017 and 2o18

I have a recurring monthly donation to specific causes, and donate sporadically on top of that. I plan to keep that situation so my giving may be a little uneven.

I also made a big donation ($10,000) on the occasion of selling my house.This I did not count as part of my annual amount.

I'm planning to donate 10% of my money after fixed costs, but am saving up 1) for tax benefits 2) to figure out where I want to donate to

My income is about to increase from 100,000 to 200,000

I am trialling the gwwc pledge in 2018 and will likely take it next year

Since I started working, I've donated at least 50% of my net income each year to charities and/or meta-charities. Since co-founding my local uni EA group, I've spent a fair amount of money on providing most of the catering etc. for our events and meetups. So I might have to include those costs for this year's donations to exceed 50% of my net income (which is quite low at the moment since I switched from full-time work to being on a student scholarship stipend.) But apart from my uni group expenses, I aim to minimise my cost of living as much as possible so that I can continue donating as much as I can (at least 50% of my income) each year. Once I'm older and have a relatively stable income I'll work out how much I need to live on and will donate everything above that amount to charity.

I'm still in school and financing my life with a mini job. Therefore I don't have too much money to spare and to donate atm unfortunately. But EA still influences my career planning.

student

I am currently a student, so individual income comes only from short internships outside academic term.

10-20% but tentative since I'm very young

Will be making 100000 next year; plan to donate at least 10% every year

10%/year forever

10% of individual income, bunched into alternate years when appropriate. In 2019 I'll donate X such that I'm caught up to that target wrt 2017 and 2018 income.

I expect when I'm financially independent from my parents I'll donate significantly more than 1%

I am an entrepreneur and I'm completely unsure about future earnings. I would like to make as much as possible and donate when I have a more livable wage for the area where I live.

I plan to start donating as soon as I start earning money and no longer am a student. I try to increase my current capital by looking into investing

I plan to donate anywhere between $20 and $400 to EA causes this year. I'm graduating from college this year, so I plan to take the Giving What We Can Pledge once I have a steady income, though I'm not sure when that will be.

Not applicable

I will start donating once I have enough money for personal development

2017 was my first year of working full time. I wanted to be sure I could pay off loans before donating 10%. Getting to 10% is my goal. I am making a career shift in 2018 so I'm not certain what I will be able to donate.

I plan to start donating in 2019 when I start making an income but am unsure of the amount. Likely 5-10% of my income, which I expect to be ~35K a year.

Once I start working I will start with the 10%.

I plan to give as much as possible over my lifetime, but it would be inefficient to do so right now, as it would require me going into debt. At the very least I intend to give 10% over my lifetime. Probably much more.

Student currently - will start work as a doctor in August 2018 (aiming to switch to international public health after 2 years of clinical work). Once I have sorted out my housing situation and a budget, I plan to take the 10% pledge

Current income much lower so reducing donations

Iâ€™m stopping donations for a few years because Iâ€™m going to do a masters in the us and am taking debt to do it

Plan to increase donation as % of income once I make more money.

I just don't give the Giving what we can Pledge because I'm the only one earning money at home and also the Brazilian Currency is currently less than 0.3 dollars pre-tax, after taxes that's even less.

My plan is to keep my donations at least level with the amount I pay in tax while I have no dependents.

hopefully once I graduate & build up a runway I'll donate everything above a reasonable level (between minimum wage and median income)

10% of pre tax income

I want to always donate at least 10% of my money, I'm willing to start in few days. Then I want to see how it affects my well-being and if it is not a problem, then I will donate more.

I use post-tax individual income since in developing countries the taxes are high, the public services poor, and I have pledged to give after retirement (until death).

I will donate when my income will rise to the level where I would have something to donate.

I'm going to talk to a tax planner about optimizing my giving when I'm in a higher tax bracket.

Once I take the pledge to give, I'll start. Hopefully soon.

Currently I'm an undergraduate, so I've been largely supported by my parents; hence the low income and donation. Once I graduate and am managing my own finances, I'm going to try to work up to 10% donation of post-tax income.

I give 10% of my monthly income at the end of each month. 2018 giving is an estimate since income may vary.

Used to donate to global poverty. Considering donating for EA-Norway

Upon retirement, I'm hoping to give the majority of my savings to a trust for ending child poverty

Plan is saving now, giving more later. Once I have financial freedom I will redirect time away from less impactful work.

The Bill Gates strategy, get very rich and then give.

Used to donate 15% of post tax income while I held a job, currently donating 25â‚¬ a month with a 300â‚¬ income (student without a job and little family support)

10% while a student, more if I get a well paying job later

Currently a student, waiting to enter employment to donate more fully

I once donated 300% of my yearly salary (which was, at the time, more than $0), but then I found out the salary of many organizations' CEO's and Presidents :(

May begin significant donations (>50% gross income) in a year or two depending on career progress

Subsidizing impoverished family access to consumer cooperatives for goods and services by local worker cooperatives.

I spend my time working as a community sustainability organizer, while I study environmental science in community colelge. I am active in local politics. I intentionally help others dismantle harmful ideas that are societally ingrained.

I plan to start my own business and work in academia after my PhD finishes this year.  The business will be dedicated to a subset of goals the EA movement has.  I am planning in enrolling in a mentorship program in Auckland in order to raise my chance of success.

my ability to donate is constrained by a lack of an extended (non-household) family safety net and the fact that I am my family's economic safety net, which causes me to keep more savings than would otherwise be needed.

Maybe if I can work again I could donate to things

Iâ€™m still a student, so Iâ€™m not making very much yet.

I plan to donate anything above what I need to live a life that sustains my motivation to do good in the long run.

Student, so planning to give more later

I may leave earning to give

I am reviewing certifications that will put me into a better position to earn to give; planning on applying to graduate programs for Fall 2019 entry. I pledge to give a minimum of half of my income over $50,000, or 10% of my total income (whichever is greater) to effective charities.

My income for the year is as yet unclear, but I plan to donate at least 10% of what I do earn.

We need to have more Partners in doing this.

I am a UK medical student with no income except loans and allowance from parents, so current donations are very small. I plan on donating a significant portion of my income once I have one, and also altering my career path to be more effective than I would be in clinical practice as a doctor.

I do not donate regularly buy you are the major benefactor of my will.

My wife and I donate money and many hours to non-profits, and to mentoring young entrepreneurs

2018 donations already made

planning to donate as much of my income as possible after I graduate

Iâ€™d like to start an organization with my savings

I should quit my job and get a higher-paying or more-effective one, but social anxiety holds me back.  :(

I would join the Giving What We Can pledge once I get a graduate, full-time job.

As a student, I'm in no position to donate. Once I finish my medical degree, I may re-evaluate that.

I fully intend to tithe to my church throughout my life. I am also committed to donating to PLAN International, the Nature Conservancy, and Heifer International, as a result of canvassing campaigns. I am further interested in requesting donations to charity as gifts throughout the year. Other charitable contributions beyond that are unplanned donations.

I maximize my savings, and plan to start donating when my financial situation stabilizes in the medium-term

Aiming for 10% yearly, including while in grad school

5 year plan to increase donations to 10 percent of earnings

I plan to increase my donations amounts over time as my income and stability grows.

Iâ€™ve previously donated regularly to multiple charities but closed those accounts to get & service a mortgage. Now I tend to buy products & gifts from (most recently) Community Aid Abroad, Bush Heritage, Aboriginal cultural experiences etc. I plan to increase donations in future as financial obligations ease, plus return to volunteering as my need to work for a wage diminishes.

I've got several million dollars that I'm planning to leave to charity when I die.  I am actively looking for a charity that will spend the money effectively, but I am disappointed with what I've found so far.

I'm a retiree. I've made legally binding arrangement to donate my entire estate.

As I have never been in full-time employment and am currently struggling to cope with University costs, my current goal is to donate 10% of my first graduate wage once I leave.

Will mainly depend on how I sort out next steps re job search.

Currently a student giving 10% I would up that dramatically depending on where my career takes me.

I am currently a student, so only donating c. the 1% level of my living expenses, but plan to donate 10% of my pre-tax income after leaving university.

As a student I currently have no reliable income

I can't consider charity donation until after I have an income (which I'm working on). But I do have plans to support the community in other ways.

Id like to approach 5% of my income

I would love to become as rich as possible and buld houses for homeless and make centres for mental therapy and help because most of people in low socioenomy circles have traumas.

I started donating to effective charities in October 2017, and have been donating 10% of my salary after tax since then. I will reduce my donation to 1% from now on, since I need to have a buffer of money to sustain myself through my future career-changes that are coming.

The pledge is ludicrous as a flat rate, but I will aim to give approximately 10% after tax while I am above a base level of salary.

I hope to donate a minimum of 5% of my income per year, and increase this percentage as quickly as I am able.

As a college student, donating is not practical but I volunteer.

I'm a student and I have a part-time campus job where I make minimum wage. I'm really trying to save up my money right now because I don't make a lot. After I graduate and get a real job I hope to donate 10% of my income to charity

I'm giving 1% at the moment because I'm a student and I'm focusing on saving. I've taken the GWWC pledge so when I start supporting myself I'll give 10%.

During years when I work in high-paying jobs, donate between 5% and 10%, during years where I am working on EA/rationality orgs, mostly donate to local organizations that I'm actually involved in

Donate a significant fraction of my future income. The more my income the greater the percentage I'll donate. Another option for a very large income would be using it to found a startup that would benefit a cause, or to leverage it in the same way.

I give 10% when I am working. I am currently a law grad student.

I am currenrly a student. Hope to get to at least a 30% a few years into working.

In 2017 I did not donate because I used my donation savings to facilitate a career change (from charity to meta-charity work)

Plan to be financially secure in a few years. Certainly start donating more then if not before.

I might Pledge

I'd like to give more but my husband is extremely resistant and we have always combined finances, so I keep working on him and in the meantime give about 10% of what I earn, plus make donations for everyone's Christmas presents.

My income went up this year and will be $35k so I am figuring out how to adjust my donations accordingly.

The amount I currently earn is enough to sustain my simple lifestyle and plan for the future. When I have a steady career, I plan to give at least 10% of my income for the rest of my life.

I'm currently saving money for graduate school and don't have 6 months runway saved up in case of emergencies; therefore, I'm planning to donate a smaller portion of my net income (~1%) until I have more stable financial conditions.

In this tax year I am donating 50% of my pre-tax income - within 1-2 years I plan to raise this to 70% and stick there for the foreseeable future.

I wish I could donate more, but am trying to increase my income and believe that it would be better for me to invest my current resources into myself to increase future returns

Roughly more than 10% of my income

I roughly plan to continue giving approximately 10% of my income, but haven't made calculating the exact figure a priority because due to living abroad and periods of unemployment calculating my actual net income is complicated.

Student right now, you know how it is.

Health issues and a new business have interfered with giving plans, but I do plan to give 10% over the long term.

na

Currently in school, plan to donate more once I enter the workforce. Prioritize direct work over earning to give

I'm a student so poor

I plan to donate all of the money I make in my hobby pottery business

I am a student, so I don't think it's effective for me to donate money now, as that means I'll have to lend more. I do plan on donating a substantial amount of my income in the future.

I'm afraid of committing to donating 10% of my life income.

My career is unstable right now (despite my master's degree), I'm irresolute as to wether I should keep giving or hedge a bit.

Planing to donate once I actually make money

Later this year I will commission as a 2nd lieutenant, meaning I'll have more money to give. The three nonprofits I support are: the ACLU, Doctors Without Borders, and Give Well.

i want to donate intellectual property

I've donated ~$10k in the past, and am currently waiting until I have stronger conclusions about where to donate.

I plan to increase the percentage of my income that will be used for donations when I have graduated, and am earning a more steady income.

I plan to conduct outreach activities this year

I was earning to give in quant finance and quit this to go into research as I felt this would have a greater impact. I'm expecting my donations to drop quite a bit in the future due to the large pay cut. In addition although I try to avoid luxuries, I'm happy to pay money to save myself time.

If I have a stable job I am planning to donate and taking the giving what we can pledge.

After bigger income and meeting my needs, I plan 10%

Not interested in earning money so don't plan to donate much, but would give most away if I were to come into money somehow.

Would like to donate 10%.    However still early in career and don't own a house, that is more important to me at the moment.    Work in corporate sector and try to promote the EA charities as much as I can.  I feel like this helps promote the cause among people with money to donate (and possibly guilt about not making the world better etc etc, or at least if they donate for tax benefit it is hopefully going to better charities than previously)

10% of income or more

Currently studying to be able to get involved

if I have enough money to exceed my debt I might donate at some point

Still studying, but finishing soon, so then I might consider these questions in more depth.

Plan to donate roughly everything over $30k

I've taken the pledge based on my base salary, and have been considering including stock and bonuses in the pledge, but haven't yet. Currently, my yearly 10% allocation is of $14,100

I plan on donating at least 10% of my income but haven't yet started my career.

Run Giving Tuesday in my country, create awareness on giving

I'm 18, and I don't have much money, nor do I even know how much I donate. It's not a lot.

I donated more in 2016 (about 10000). At the moment the Xrisk targets I'm sure I'd like to support like BERI, MIRI, FHI don't seem to be short in funding. I don't plan to donate until that changes or I find similar targets that are short on funding.

I spend a lot of time working on project that so far have not resulted in anything.

I plan on signing the giving what we can pledge after graduate school. I also plan on giving any inheritance I receive from my grandfather to charity

We try to donate 10% of our income to charity each tax year. But I would like to give more once I am earning again (currently a stay-at-home mom with a few small non-executive director and part-time roles).

Haven't really started getting into it yet, but I am reaaaaally tempted, which is way more charitable than I've ever felt before.

I donâ€™t earn a lot, and I have enough savings to live on, but not much more. Late 2017 I finally decided I can probably afford to be donating at least a little, so Iâ€™m now donating Â£5 per month.

I am currently a student. Gave 1% last year, trying to push myself to give 5% this year, will give a minimum of 10% when I leave university.

Will continue to donate approximately 1 per cent of income into the future.

I plan to give 10% of my pre-tax income every year. I didn't take the pledge because making a permanent decision, makes me uncomfortable.

Save most of my money and only donate near the end of my life, or once I have a solid idea that the cause I donate to will result in long-run inclusive institutions

I donate my time and skills, rather than money.

I currently need a bit of help with my personal budget to be quite frank but giving is in the cards for sure.

I need to get clear of my highest interest debts before I can become an active EA donor.

Planning to take the 10% pledge - currently a student with no source of income

I am broadly on board with the 10% Schelling point, but intend to go below/above this according to my income each year.

My spouse and I both have increasing medical and house-hold expenses that impact ability to donate.

Planning to start at 3% this year and increase by at least 1% a year until I feel I can't

I plan to significantly increase my donations after graduation/when I find employment.

Giving 1% of (gross income minus education costs). I'm saving and investing to achieve early financial independence and give more later.

I won't be able to donate since until I start making more money.

Hope to donate to charity once I have a job where I am able to support myself.  Currently a student.

At this time i am in college, and it is easier to donate time instead of money. I would like acscess to a series of vetted companies who have proven effectiveness

I want to move from ETG into social entrepreneurship if at all possible and save up some runway for that. I think I can still donate some 20â€“30% right away. Iâ€™d also be ready to go into direct work or research if any suitable opportunity presents itself, in which case more savings would come in handy too.

I plan to donate at least 10% of my post tax income each year. I am unsure how much of my savings I will end up donating, since I have only recently started working.

I donated 200 euros at the start of this year, might donate an additional 100 euros

Once my emergency fund is replenished, will do regular giving.

10% at least; I've taken the pledge! Depending on career path an family needs, hope to work up to 50% of my individual income (expected 50% of $250-400k in 10-15 years).

I'm currently living below the poverty line.

I am donating 2,5 % of the shares of my two companies to EA causes.

I have three young children and a pay a lot for housing and childcare costs. I plan to increase donation when they are all in school ie when our childcare costs have decreased.

I usually donate 10% of my post-tax income. Since a recent incident resulted in me losing several thousand EUR, I might adjust my donations to compensate for that (in part). I try to base the money I donate on the amount I have available for my well-being and I haven't figured out yet which payments should count as lowering my income fully, partly, or not at all.

As a student, I am currently donating 1% of all my income.

I plan on ramping up my donations once I am no longer a student.

Currently unemployed and living off savings.  Will donate more in the future.

I'll donate at least 10% of my income as soon as I start working (I'm still a student) .

Decided to pursue higher paying job, with eventual desire to work for an NGO

I plan to increase donations substantially after paying down mortgage.

Expect to donate more in future, need to pay off loans and get something of a safety net of savings.

Interested in donating to x risk/WAS that has tax deductibility status in AUS.

I plan to ramp up donations over time via investment returns, effectively acting as a high return endowment for charities I deem important.

Donate 10% of my income up to median UK income, then an increasing % until I give away everything above 75th percentile of post-tax income.

Get up to min 10%

I'm a member of Giving What We Can, so I plan to donate 10% of my income for the rest of my life.

I don't donate much at the moment as I am still a student and devote most of my money towards savings for studies and related expenses. I live as frugally as I reasonably can and once I gain fulltime employment plan to donate significantly more of my income.

600/year until I finish PhD (2017 was for two years and a $250 one-time donation), more later depending on career

Not planning to donate less of my salary but I may receive less work bonus and received less tax refunds this year than last year, so I may have less to donate overall.

After runway established, plan to increase to 5%, then eventually 10%.

I believe that donating to local causes not deemed to be priorities by a broad EA consensus is a good idea.

I can't afford to donate funds, so I donate time and skills.

Student debt currently making it hard to donate.

EA will heavily influence my estate planning.

Investments are a more epistemologically sound means of improving the world than charities.    I believe charity will be rendered obsolete by new methods of value capture.

I plan on donating 10% of my net income for the next few years whilst I figure out what more I can do in the future.

I plan to take the pledge after college.

When I stabilize out of college, I want to take the pledge.

I would like to take the Pledge from 2019 onwards

I generally donate $500 for my birthday every year. My friends, in the last two years, have also started doing birthday campaigns, for which I generally donate an additional ~$150-$200.

At some point in the near future I would like to take the "Giving What we can" Pledge, but at the moment my salary is quite low until next academic year.

I'm highly risk averse and focused on saving money to ensure personal financial security. Failing contingencies, my hope is ultimately apply this money to EA causes.

Will donate when I have a tad bit more money.

Still PhD student so at the moment I am remaining flexible with my donations but hope to ramp up in the future.

I am currently a student and do not have regular income. So I donate 1% of what I earn. I will slowly increase this to 2, 5 and 10 as I pay off my debts.

I am used to donate volunteer hours (more than 150 hours a year).

Intending roughly 10% of post-tax household income, at least until we retire.

donation is basically useless compared to changing the technology landscape to better accommodate humans

I got diagnosed with a mental illness during my studies. I did get my BA. After difficult years i started playing sports. It has transformed my life. The medz caused me to gain 40 kilos. I lost 20 kilos, gained sincere friends and am feeling great. I got a challenging part time and am building my life.     I am mentioning this because this 80000 hours thing comes across as only for the elite. Like it is a project for someones resume. And that really bothers me. I want and i can contribute too!!! I too want and can make a difference!!!    I would like to get some actionable suggestions on how, for my situation.    And one other thing: i read the job guide on this site quite some time ago so im not entirely sure if this was in there. But the best way to figure out if an occupation would be a good fit, is to try it out in small steps and to talk to ppl in the field. Read about it, actually perform the tasks, interview ppl etc.    And thanks for creating this site and podcast! Its a great initiative!

The current practice and future plan is to always give 10% of after-tax income.

I plan to donate 10% post-tax at my current salary of $50K USD per year, and increase the percentage as my post-tax income rises

I am uncertain about my income or required funds in the next 10 years so am prioritising flexibility for now

Im using post-tax data cause in Brazil we cant retake a cent on donnations to AE causes as tax returns.

I donate my time, not money, and I am unsure about how to translate all the amount of time spent into a currency amount.

Aiming to increase income/donations significantly over the next 1-3 years.

I would donate more when I earn more and have moved out

Still working for runway and investing in skills for long-term direct impact and significant donations if income high enough

Once I start earning money, I plan to donate as much as possible while not making debilitating sacrifices in my own well-being.

I am a professional poker player, so my income is highly uncertain. I have donated $3,000 so far (to cover 10% of profits from this and last year) and will donate 10% of any future profits.

Currently a college student -- don't have a current steady income, and make mostly small, one time donations

I donate at the beginning of the year for the previous year. The year in which I donate then does not match 10% of my salary for the same year. It gets confusing the way the Giving What We Can website tracks it.

Plan is to get into quant trading for working to give as I am decent mathematically.

Only going to start earning for real in 2018

Currently a student but when I have a stable income, I plan to take the GWWC pledge and donate at least 10% of my income (possibly more) to effective charities.

I am saving to buy a small house (in the Netherlands), after I have achieved that. I intend to donate substantially more.

I also give significantly to groups like the ACLU, but don't count it, as it's more akin to paying to maintain the house I live in.

Student

I'm currently saving as much of my income as possible for graduate tuition. I've decided not to donate substantially until after I finish my graduate degree, so that I won't have to borrow as much money, and consequently won't owe as much interest and will be able to donate more in the future.

My 2017 donation of $1500 (I was trying to hit a target of $2000 total) was delayed and only officially happened in early 2018, hence the plan to donate 3500 in 2018.

Not donating as working directly in cause area.

I work less to have more time running a local EA group. So I currently focus on donating time.

I need to focus on earning more and repaying some debts and better investments to donate more in the future. I am also planning to establish a startup around effective learning (direct work) but also possibly in order to earn to give.   Currently I donate to GiveDirectly and some other local Kenyan projects and also to some ad hoc areas like street work with drug addicts, etc. in Slovakia.

I will focus on direct NGO-work as well as on earning to give as soon as I finished my masters

I am currently a full-time student, and not working a regular job; I intend to begin a regular donation commitment once I have a reliable income.

I plan to donate significantly more in the future, after making a career transition from theoretical physics to a different area of research.

Increase as wage increases.

I plan to reach 10% of my individual pre-tax income.

I am currently working as a Peace Corps Volunteer so I do not make any money. That being said, after reading Peter Singer's book and 80,000 Hours website, I plan to donate 5-10% of my income when I make money again.

Increase yearly donation by $1000 each year until at 10% of income, or faster if I have a large increase in income

Not Really.   Nah.

Currently, as a student I give away roughly 1% of my spending money; I am currently planning to give away 10% of my income once I'll receive one

I'm still a student so I hope to increase donations substantially once I get one of those job things.

Currently investing man hours and $$ in local community based projects.

In a couple of years, I will have saved enough that I will either donate 100% of my disposable income, or do direct EA work (in which case I would still continue to donate if I get paid doing EA work).

I plan to build up more of a financial runway before increasing donations.

Once I have some savings built up, I'd like to consistently donate somewhere between 10% and [income - $20k].

My reconciliation period is life long and I count all household income ever earned by each family member as giving taxable.

I think it is wise to focus on building a stable financial foundation while I'm in college and grad school, so as much as it causes "am I a good person???" crises, I don't plan to donate much for several years. Once we have a financial safety net, my fiance and I plan to donate 5-10% of income every year. We'll think about it a lot more, but at the moment, it sounds like donating a significantly higher percentage later in life makes sense.

I'm unemployed. I'm likely starting a job soon and will somewhat likely be on a fairly good career path (EA-wise).

I am a university student in the United States, so I have very little financial security and no job, but once that changes I plan to donate more.

Discounting based off of expected investment return

The greatest part of my regular donations goes to causes that are determines on the basis of effectiveness and efficiency criteria.

I tend to invest morethan donate.

Student, currently donating >1%

I am currently a student donating internship money. There's a roughly 10% chance I fail to go to grad school and immediately start working in software engineering, and will be donating at least 10% of a six figure salary.

I hope and expect to get an job soon; I intend to donate about 10% of my income once I actually have an income to speak of.

2017 - student.   2018 - job

Poor student. Will up the % in the future

I'm saving up so I can be more financially stable in the future and donate more later

Donating much time, less money.

I am limited by my health and may not be able to donate as much as I'd like because of struggling to pay rent due to my disability

The above numbers are very very crude

I'm multiply disabled for now, so I can't work and can't donate any money. Hopefully someday.

i will be allotting over 10 per cent of my estate in my will to EA charities

All our donating is done in my husband's name at this stage for ease of claiming tax rebates (since he is the main income earner). Together we currently donate $50 per month and we will evaluate the effect that has had on our finances at the end of one year with a view to increasing it.

I plan to save most of my money in order to be more versatile with my donations. It may turn out to be optimal not to donate but to spend money on my own projects (e.g. research assistants). I have a high degree of confidence in my future self's ability not to waste these savings.

IÂ´d love to donate for contraception and family planning to reduce the population in poor countries if i find an effective organisation which does mainly this but the EA community and the internet couldnÂ´t help me with a satisfying answer so far.

I support my church

I do not track my donations, these are estimates.

My primary way of doing good is via direct work. I might donate more in any given year if there is an especially good opportunity that seems like it would otherwise be lacking funds.

My partner and I currently, and plan to donate 10% of our household income

Not currently earning, have donated a bit but my opinion about best place to donate is still changing. This year I will start earning and will get donation matching from my employer, so will start donating more

I am currently a student and I am planning on starting donating once I finish studying

Labour fpr money should be massivley reduced, so my plan is Earning to Live and Live to Change the World

I encouraged my parents to donate 1000 euros to GiveWell, and I plan to donate more once I'll be a worker, but as a student I still can't afford to donate much

I am a student and can't afford much. I want the financial security to have a stable, regular donation going on.

I grew up as a Christian giving at least 10% ever since first earning an income. My husband is also a Christian but did not have the same expectations around giving. We are currently compromising at 5% of our household income. We hope to increase that amount over the years.

Currently building up one year minimal income (7200) to gain some flexibility on my carrer path. Want to donate more after.

Income has gone up this year (~Â£38k), and I've finally started fulfilling the GWWC pledge

Student who plans to found a startup, I think it makes more sense for me to start donating later to maximize the amount.

I would like to donate, per year, what ever amount is the estimated cost for saving one human life that year.

As my income goes up (I will finish my PhD soon) I intend to donate more though whether at 10% or some other figure remains to be seen.

I took the GWWC Pledge. As I work and make money, I intend to gradually liquidate my cryptocurrency holdings through donations. It is possible that at some point I will take the Further Pledge.

I plan to donate at least 10% for as long as I can.

I plan to continue to donate as much as I can and I plan to leave 32 % of my estate to charities in my will

10% of taxable income

Saving up, investing, etc. Have a good sum to donate in the future.

I switched to a higher earning career in part in order to be able to give more

Not counting comapny matching, and sometimes double matching (company + colleagues)

I donate half of my earnings to a bank Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

My husband and I are donating 15% and lumping donations so we donate every other year to avoid taxes. Will increase donations once we have a set amount in savings.

I have donated at least 10% of my gross income since I started working full time in 2012, and recently increased to 12.5%. I plan to maintain a similar or moderately increased giving level, depending on my earnings and career path.

Focusing on skillbuilding / career capital now. When I have a more established career I will decide whether to donate more than 10% or to invest in startups.

When I get a job I plan to donate far above 10%.

I take in homeless trans people (or in an unsafe area) and attempt help them by giving them a place to stay, find a job and new housing.

So far I have only donated to the Against Malaria Foundation. I work for AI Impacts and BERI as a contractor, though, and enjoy it (and other AI-related work).

Plan to stick to my Pledge10 and challenge myself to increase this with time based on circumstance or time spent volunteering.

Plan to donate 1% while a student, 10% when working. I don't restrict my donations to "Effective" charities.

I am a student, not sure how student loans should be entered. I excluded it from these numbers.

Roughly 5% of my income

I need an algorithm which i am working on to decide what is an effective way to allocate any money i have. The EA algorithm is too vague for me to use. It reminds me of Paul Ehrlich's (of Stanford) equation for the environment I=PAT . Very vague.

I just look at my financial situation at the end of the year and make donation decisions ad hoc

I would donate more if I knew for sure I would be working over the next few years

We have an annual giving budget which I organise, but the donations are jointly made.

I have been donation procrastinating

I plan to gradually increase the percentage of income that I give to charity over the years, as my income increases.

2018 income is 14500

In a few weeks I'll start at a salaried position (~50k/yr) and will be determining a donation plan that looks very different from last year's.

As I'm currently a student I don't plan on donating before my graduation but to spend my time focusing on building my 'career capital'.

The issue I am most concerned about is self-determination for Aboriginal people - my time and skills are more use than my money

Currently up to 3-4% of income (was previously donating ~1%). Planning to work my way up to 10% over the next year or so.

Continue to donate half of income to launch ALLFED, but may transition to fully direct work.

I would like to save enough money that would sustain me for 6 months if I ever lost my job/emergencies/etc. Once I reach that goal I will start donating around 10% monthly.

I'm currently a college student, and I'm trying to maintain some savings in case my parents cut me off for being queer/trans, so I'm not in a position to donate.  This is why I don't identify as an "effective altruist", although I do plan to earn-to-give once I actually have a job.

I plan to donate 10% of *post*-tax income, plus various amounts to provide disincentives to myself (for e.g. frivolous spending) and to act as moral offsets.

I intend to 20% of my after tax salary

I am a researcher at a public institution (sorbonne university) and I can barely buy lunch at the end of the month. I hope to contribute through my work.

We donate to several charities and I am now volunteering a significant amount of time to an educational nonprofit that I co-founded in 2016

Still trying to get my numbers up, striving for 10%.

I am currently staying at just over 10%. As my income increases I plan to increase this. I do not have more specific plans than that.

invest and save now, donate later

Once I am out of school, I plan to donate at least 10%. For now, my priorities are on personal investment.

Will soon receive will of family memberâ€”plan to donate at least 10% immediately, perhaps more later on

My actual, set-in-stone and/or highly probable annual donation plans remain uncertain and open to critical input from EAs and/or anyone interested in philanthropy & ethical consequentialism-derived generosity and altruism.

i plan to donate as much as i can afford, and am planning to live with roommates/not go on expensive vacations/etc to reduce costs

pre-tax income for a year is hard to predict.  I use last year's for setting each year's donations, but have increased donation rate to 15%.

student

I use the Life You Can Save calculator that calculates how much I should donate as a percentage of my income. Right now I am not donating as I should due to debts and school but once I am free of debt, I will be making sure I donate as much as I should be.

I'm currently a student, but have been making a lot of money each summer through software engineering internships. I donated 12.5% last summer because I'm trying to test out how much I would enjoy learning to give. These are normal big tech companies that I wouldn't classify as direct impact, so it's been nice to try to start early on doing this.    Has the community thought about how we communicate donations with students and young people? Would the community give the advice to recent grads to start donating, or wait for financial capital to do so?    I'm of the belief that we need to start now to form the habit while we're young. There will always be an excuse for waiting; right now it's "I'm a broke college student", next year it's "I'm a recent grad and don't have the money", in 10 years it's "I'm saving up for my down payment" etc.     It would be really great to have an 80,000 hours article on donations and how it ties into the timeline of your career (including if you are *not* trying to earn to give as your career strategy).

student, no cash

I want to shift my donating plans from organisations like UNICEF to other causes that are more effective. I also would like to pledge half of every raise I get (after graduating) to causes that are effective.

Planing on doing ~/13 gross income per year for the foreseeable future (Except currently looking to donate this year's 1/3 AND next year's 1/3 all next year for tax purposes. Similar structures may re-occur.)

Most donations going to "top charities" by givewell.

I plan to start donating more when once graduate.

Took Giving What We Can pledge

I'm unsure about how much I'll donate this year. I made some lucky gains from gambling my wealth on cryptocurrencies in 2017. Most of my wealth will at some point be donated to EA-chairities/projects or spent to fund own projects, but I probably wont spend much of it this year.

I've been trying to find ways to donate that don't cost me anything (because I make little and pay student loans), such as CharityMiles, where you run/walk for charity and your ad sponsors donate.

I'd rather donate my time than money, as it creates a larger impact. Imagine what we could change in the world if people all came together without money involved.

I do plan to donate more money to causes I care about when my income is substantial, and have done so in the past.

Income is going up to 180k/year

My husband and I plan to continue to give 15% of our combined gross income each year, which we have been doing for the last few years (previously we gave 10%). All of this goes to organizations that are consistent with EA.

I expect to use 10% as a rough heuristic, and also anything beyond household needs and savings goals (currently set at anything beyond 135k for a family of 4 in the Bay)

My intention is to start generating a high regular income again in order to be able to donate more.

During 2017 I lost a job and got into some significant debt  because I was using my credit card to buy food. I also got an unexpected Â£1,565 bill from the council (my landlord had incorrectly told me that I didn't have to pay council tax when I moved). I later got a new job but was unable to make donations as I had to concentrate on paying off my debts. I also had various expenses related to getting a k1 visa to move to the US to live with my then fiance, now husband. I have now acquired my visa and moved and got married and do not yet have a work permit here. My lawyer has advised me I will probably not get a work permit until September. I am currently financially dependent on my husband. I intend to get a job as soon as I can and resume donating 10%. I have never had very high paid jobs and probably won't in the future, but if anyone has advice on ho to get a high paying job with my skills I would be interested to know.

I live in a developing country, so my plan is first to secure my self and my close ones and then I will consider to donate according to the consesus of long-termist EAs

Donating at 2% of annual income every 2 years, as I'm a student. Planning to go up to minimum 10% once I stop being a student.

I will take the pledge

I plan to cause roughly 10% of my ordinary income to be donated as effectively as possible.

- I "donated" by doing direct work   - I kept my savings to get to the minimum recommended runway  - For now I am relying on my savings and will likely not extend my runway significantly in 2018

Likely all over ~20K EUR/yr income.

I use a progressive taxation system on my net income to set a floor on my giving. 10% up to 50k, 20% on next 50k, 30% On next etc

I can't make any certain donation plans at the moment because I'm a student and have no job.

Went down because I started doing direct work.

I'm currently studying and living on student loans, my current plan is to take a pledge to donate either 5% or 10% of my income as soon as I have a steady job and cash flow. This should be within a year with the path I'm currently on.

I transitioned jobs in 2018 (to the AR movement) and took a significant pay cut. This is why I plan to donate less money in 2018.

Unforeseen circumstances required me to take on a lot of debt. I plan on repaying my debt before I begin donating again. Prior to 2017 I donated 10% of my pre-tax income.

10%  Considering donating all above median wage

Would like to be donating 10% at minimum for rest of life. Have disability which costs me 10% of my income approx and could get worse. Do not currently break even, but have some savings.

Upon securing a high-paying job, I want to start donating 15% of my income, hopefully to work towards 50% as my income increases.

IÂ´m a student, working half-time as an analyst (creating solutions within the field of healt care) also taking care of sick husband. The plan is to keep myself floating, to be able to get into research program, to be able to contribute with amazing research and donate more money. First things first though.

The "plan to donate" number would be a lot lower if I end up doing direct work.

I've taken the Giving Pledge but prioritise my own financial runway right now. I do make a lot of costs for my charity in terms of travel, small expenses, etc.

Just started career in 2017 - only worked for 2 months.

Donation plans highly variable, depends on if I move to direct work/research or stay in EtG

Am currently re-training. Plan to donate more once re-trained.

While I give 10% of annual income, years ago my household put 10% of a major win into a donor-advised fund, and most of my annual donations now come from that fund. So the response to the 2017 income question is misleading in terms of my capacity to donate. (Conversely, if you counted the original DAF creation as a 10% donation, then our annual donations now are much lower.)

Once I am no longer a student (and in high debt/low income situations) I would like to be more open with donating my money.

Gift aid tax rebate is good incentive in UK.

Doubled by employer matching

I will donate less this year, than last year, as 80,000 hours recommend you save up enough money to have 6 months of living expenses in savings. I am not sure whether this is recommended for danish citizens, as we have a solid wealthfare system, however I will hold back donations as per recommendation of 80000 hours.

Donations are pooled with spouse, went with 0 for easiness here.

not enough money yet, planning to start donating in the next years

I'm not sure how much exactly, but I plan to donate more if/when I start earning more than my current, non-profit salary.

(I'm a student)

I'm studying right now and don't have an income, so just donate a small amount of my student loan and savings. Once I do I'll give as much as I can.

I'm looking to leverage my skills to improve the operation of organizations that help people.

I hope to donate more once I'm better positioned for retirement and own a home.

Once I get a job, build up a contingency fund (for 1 year living). Thereafter donate everything in the goal of maximising AI safety, according to recommendations by EA / OpenPhil / etc.

I will take the Giving What We Can Pledge as soon as I make, on average, more than minimum wage.

Plan to donate all money above some level (probably close to some low average income)

I donate to givewell

Additionally to GiveWell and ACE I would love to have a website where other charities - for example in research of biosecurity and others - are evaluated

I currently work for development organization s that limit my income but increase my community impact

Not sure what the questions above are about - is it total donations to charity or just to those associated with / recommended by EA organisations ?

Currently a student with limited funds but when i start work I aim to contribute more

I will be attending graduate school the next 3-4 years and therefore will not be able to donate as much as I would want.

The donation amounts are half my joint donations with my partner.

Since I dedicate my work life to EA issues, involving high personal financial risks (entrepreneurship), I don't plan to donate much unless my financial status stabilizes.

The reason 2017 was such a high number was because I decided to get my total donation number to be 10% of my lifetime income.  I started earning money in 2007.  I added up my total income from 2007 to 2017, and donated enough to get to 10% of that sum.  I intend to donate 20% in 2018.

My employer matches most of my donations (up to 6000 USD / year).

I really hope that I get to a point in life after studies where I can better afford to help other people.

I rather offer my time to a cause than donating. I think EA should also focus in those people who are interested in donating their instead their money

Planning to *not* donate anything on 2018 because I was convinced, by listening to Robin Hanson, to go to the "give later" route.

Currently not donating much, but have self-imposed a luxury tax where I donate 2x what I spend on non-critical things (like vacations, clothing, personal appearance). Plan to donate more once I've established a stable career

Why don't you ask what the pre-tax household income is in 2018? Isn't that super relevant when also asking about donations this year? Anyways, I couldn't properly answer the questions here anyways, because language barrier probably. Or I am just dumb, dunno.

I am not planning to donate until I have repaid my student loans.

Planning to work directly or in research and donate at least 10%, at least if it isn't already factored out of my income if I'm working directly at an EA place

in 2018 I will be working for an EA org and I negotiated my (low) salary on the basis that I wouldn't be giving.

I give what to can. But I also donate time to help which is valuable as well. My hope is to find work in an field that allows me to push toward altruism financially and be an active voice.

Once I begin earning money, I plan on donating a significant portion (~10%) of it every year.

I must begin

Have been unemployed for the last 18 months. I have previously, and intend to continue donating 10% of my income once I am employed again.

I plan to take the Giving What We Can pledge once I pay off student and car loans.

Income is very "lumpy"/unpredictable at the moment (majority comes from success in crypto investments). I am not donating an appreciable percentage right now, and instead plan to determine how to use the money over time, probably with some sort of larger-scale project.

I plan to increase my donations to at least 10% of my income when I pay off debts and find stable employment.

#NAME?

I'm a student so I don't donate much money. I donate mostly for promoting it to others and for feeling connected to the charities.

Weight towards post-grad school.

Given the new US tax plans, I intend to concentrate major donations every 3rd or 4th year for tax optimization.

I'll take the 1% pledge as soon as I get some kind of financial support from university as an assistant for research or teaching and probably take the 10% one when enter the job market. Maybe not if I decide to work directly, donating sporadically only. Or I could take the temporary pledge to be sure before the permanent one for about a year.

I plan to save money and focus on building my career this year.

I expect to increase my donations when I get higher income.

Have an internet startup idea. If that doesn't work, go into research

I donate my career rather than funds

I think maybe a focus for younger EAs who think that they are going to be committed in the long- term is to think about donating later, and maybe build up personal savings first

Delaying donating until I know more; also, delaying donating to minimise personal catastrophic risk

Once I've personally got a solid, predictable salary I will donate 10% of my post-tax income (at least) to effective charities. Most likely givedirectly.

Plan to donate significantly more once I have a meaningful income

Although I believe in global issues/priorities, I am personally prioritizing local needs (schools, parks, etc.)

Plan to donate roughly all my money besides ~1 million per child & spouse between a metacharity and poverty reduction / open borders charities. Also, I am likely to eventually spend large amounts of my money, energy, and time working on causes directly myself.

Will donate more once I have an income

My career is risky and income is highly uncertain, so I do not currently feel comfortable with a very significant level of giving.

Going through a career change right now and so figuring out my next career step. $3000 plan to donate is based on anticipated income by end of the year.

I support a homeless individual, including making sure he gets medical and dental care.

I need to increase my income, or wait a little while, as my family situation makes it hard to donate more.

My future donations'll be lower if I take a job at a non-profit (15% chance it'll happen this year).

I am currently an undergraduate college student. I am graduating this May, and will hopefully have a full-time job and be able to donate 10% beginning in September or October.

I plan to give at 20% of pre-tax income, as per above, while I finish school. After I begin working, I hope to gradually increase to 50% of pre-tax income.

Quit my job to do independent, direct work (aka no income).

In 2017, I had a full-time job for 3 months and donated based on The Life You Can Save calculator.    I'm going to university this fall, so my plans for this year will change from 10% of my part-time income (spring-summer) to 1% of my spending money, which will be calculated monthly.

Hoping to get more involved with my grandparent's charitable giving foundation. Foundation made ~750k gifts to charitable organizations in 2016. I consider increasing my involvement to be very high impact.

I plan on Taking the Pledge later this year, once I have reached my personal financial goals

I will be starting a PhD program next year that pays a $40000 stipend. I hope to donate 1% until I pay off my student loans, then increase it to at least 10%. My loans should be paid off within the next two years.

Paying off debts and building runway before prioritizing donations.

I currently am a student, and intend to significantly increase giving once I have reasonable income of my own, likely about the 10% 'giving what we can' level.

I aim to donate 10-20%.

I am a student without income at the moment. I am not sure how much I would donate. I think 10 % sounds like a fair percentage.

During my first year in employment I donated less and saved for runway. Still saving but less: 50% of the the saving amount goes to donations this year, 75% next year.

I am a freshman in college. I plan to give more as I begin to earn more

I was previously working for a meta-charity (CEA) and am starting a non-profit for community health in Berkeley.  So I am donating time rather than money.  Arguably how effective my time is, but counterfactually I could be making >$120k and am instead making next to nothing, so eh?

I have a boyfriend who is not much into donating, but reading books about this has made me more able to give support to my feelings and the importance of giving.

I cannot donate until I am in a significantly better place financially. My household income does not reflect my personal ability to make financial decisions as I am currently a dependent, unfortunately.

0

I have signed up to support Cool Earth

I intend to take the pledge this September, upon starting my new job.

Currently student and donate 4-5% of income. Plan to increase to 10+% after getting real job.

higher donations not possible, currently part-time working student

i am involved in research related to conservation biology. Our income is just enough for our lifestyle. I cannot afford to donate with the current income. I also feel that since i am working in this field I need not donate

Non-working student, planning to give in 4-5years when Im done studying

invest it all in effective charitable startups or organizations, not necessarily donating

I'm a student with debt. Once I'm not studying anymore and I'm earning more I would like to donate according to the giving what you can pledge.

Make lower than most ea people

I have until now worked on short-contract research stipends and have delayed significant donations in favour of building up savings. I am currently unemployed, but would denote if I were to have permanent income in the future.

trying to get some tax refunds on my donations so I can donate more, effectively

I am a PhD student on scholarship  but plan to give more when Iâ€™m on a full salary

I volunteer in an effective charity, so as a student my time is my best donation.

I have reservations about earning to give and i have high standards of information for investing in projects and no money currently and not prioritising getting money. I prefer direct work on meta causes.

depends on number of factors but will aim to give at least 20% of net profit

currently focused on direct work, may donate more if that makes sense in future

I aim at 20% and see how it works, as soon as I'll have steady income.

2018 - 10%  2019 - 15%  2020 - 15  2021 - 20  2022 - 25  2023 - 30  2024 - 40  2025 - 50%    Rough goals.

I'm currently a PhD student. Earning-to-give considerations may push me away from working at a teaching university and towards working in industry after graduation.

I'm a student, no income

I want to give more, but I have to get out of debt first.

IÂ´m still a student and spending all the money IÂ´m making on living costs, occassionaly donate to some EA charities within some fundraisor. My donations will depend on the job IÂ´m going to find

I would love to donate more once my school loans are paid off

Currently student, will follow GWWC pledge when have full income (expect this income to be ~Â£20,000 during PhD etc)

I have structured my corporation to donate services as well as money to philanthropic organizations, as well as tree planting annually and using carbon offsets. This commitment is something we encourage clients to do as well.

I plan to start donating when I start working

I am disabled and have no prospects for earning money, but I intend to donate all money that somehow falls into my lap.

Currently not donating as saving for heavy upcoming planned expenses

currently aiming at 15-20%

When Iâ€™m working again (currently a student) I expect to donate more

Until I am relatively certain about cause priority and have some accumulated capital I do not plan to donate much.

I calculate my donations as a % of AGI (US tax code) and have been increasing by 5% each year and intend to continue to do so for the next few years and then reevaluate.

My income is currently static, pension, of low amount.  Everything has to be juggled for the next unforeseen expense.  Donations a luxury

Unsure whether to take the GWWC pledge - as of now, prioritising getting an effective career above all else, and hesitant to burden myself with monetary donations as well for fear of value drift/i like nice stuff

Besides other hesitations I'm working through, I still don't know where to point my money that seems like it will actually affect AI stuff â€” I don't have a super high opinion of MIRI based on my friends' take on its usefulness

I am early career and paying off student debt, but hope to begin to contribute much more to charity later in life - I believe that the focus now on my career will allow me to donate more in the future since my wealth overall will be higher

Invest to give or give at least 10% once a professional.

Birthday matching after getting job, currently I am a student.

I currently have unusually good investment opportunities, so I expect to donate more later.

GWWC pledge @ 10% for now, probably increasing as I earn more

Time + Career Capital > Money

They are not to effective charities. They are part of entry to sporting events I wish to participate in and that happen to be connected to charities.

I'm planning to transition into management consulting within the next year and will subsequently donate a considerable portion of my income (at least 10%), after having paid off my partner's student loans.

I am retired

Will be acquiring gainful employment soon, so amount should increase.

Currently a student and cannot donate much money, however once I begin working plan to donate large amounts of my income/invest and donate in future years

underemployed due to health issues and do not expect to be a high earner

I am currently a student in computer science. I plan to donate after my University degree.

Current priority is to build up a 6 month security deposit for ourselves. Then we'd like to start giving 5%, and gradually increase that to 100% over the years.

Took the trying to give pledge this month opting for a 5% donation plan

I am doing full time activism

Increase donations to 10% or more after I get a mortgage

I give in time more than anything else becaus that's all I have right now

I am currently a college student. I do not plan to donate much this year because I am not working. In the future I would like to donate at least 20% of my income (this will depend on how much I earn).

I intend to take the Giving What We Can pledge shortly before or after graduating

Was not aware of EA in 2017

I only started regularly donating this year, and now have monthly recurring donations in place.

I plan to donate 50% of my money in excess of $1M and am saving aggressively to achieve that goal first.

My main goal with my career is to retire early with a high standard of living for my family. I plan to continue giving even when I have no salary, which is why I donate a relatively small fraction of my income now. Overall I think that my aspirations are selfish which is why I don't consider myself an effective altruist.

I hope to donate 10% minimum of my income over my life. Hopefully much more if I am able.

I would sincerely like to donate more but I earn far less than my husband because I currently work at a non profit research organization. Also, dispite our healthy household income, we are currently running at a deficit because (after taxes are taken into consideration) we have two young children in daycare and we live in a city with a very high cost of living, so after housing, daycare, transportation and other fixed costs, we're losing $700 a month until our oldest starts school. We haven't been on vacation for years, we don't have a large home or a new vehicle or cable. It's frustrating not to be making greater headway when you feel like you're doing the right things to try and get ahead while still making a positive impact. I would like to donate much more to evidence based causes in the future, but I haven't figured out how to broach this with my husband since he is not off the same mind. For now, we can't afford to anyway, so I won't worry about it for the next few years.

I plan to give at least 10% of total earnings over my lifetime. Depending on my career trajectory, perhaps I will aim higher.

As soon as I graduate and have a job, I plan to take the Giving What We Can pledge.

Somewhat ambivalent about donating, now that I know there are many resources dedicated to EA causes. Also planning to move to a higher income job (with employer matching maybe), so potentially increase the donation.

I feel it is important for personal--not altruistic reasons--to achieve financial security first before giving substantially. I have a clear number in mind ($50k in annual withdrawals in perpetuity, so likely $2 million in savings).     My hope is that my career can contribute a lot when I feel financially free to pursue any course of action, whether that is earning to give, fundraising, or working directly on an important cause.

I am going to do backpacking for a year next year, and study for at least 5 after that. I do not know how my finances will look in these years, but I will have low/no income in the time. I will therefore save more now untill I am more certain in where I stand financially

I will probably work in a field that is directly altruistic, so won't donate as much as if I had pursued a high-income career.

For complicated personal reasons, I'm not able to donate very much of my income at the moment. I'm kind of ok with this since I think the "save/invest now, donate later" strategy is a viable alternative to ongoing giving. My goal is for my lifetime giving to average out to about 25% of my income.

I'm currently a student living on my parents' money, who do not approve of donating, but I am planning to donate 10% when I have a job

Just starting out building career & capital in the past couple of years and so I'm planning to readjust and start a GWYC pledge within 5-10 years

My fiancÃ© and I are currently collectively giving 10% and intend to increase it overtime. I would like to do at least 20% if I make $100K, and more as it goes up.

my spouse retired in 2016, I have semi-retired in 2018

My household income is quite low, and I work while doing an undergrad degree.    I plan to donate 100% of income over some sustainable level upon securing gainful employment after University. That number would be, roughly, 35,000â‚¬

I'm in the last year of PhD funding at the moment, I want to build up a buffer for if I have to extend for a few months. Intend to go back to 10% again when I return to full time employment.

Unable to give a significant amount as I am trying to save for a house deposit on a PhD student income. I intend to give more after completing my PhD, conditional on getting a decent job.

At least: Against malaria foundation, artsen zonder grenzen, leprastichting, WWF.  Probably some deworming  Maybe animal charities, fred hollows, project healthy children

I believe that the moral responsibility to donate to effective charities is very similar to the progressive taxation (the richest individuals and institutions should donate much more than average citizens). I also donate less money that I intend to donate in future, expecting significant reduction in charity-related uncertainties in the next decade.

I used to donate ~5% but I'm now donating closer to 1.5% because I'm saving up to buy a small house.

My family donates to non EA causes, totalling over 10% of our combined income. I give at least 10% of my income to EA causes specifically

I am earning good money, but this is rather new and i am just out of my debts. So when I have some money saved for me, my donations should get up.   For 2018 for example these 5000 Euros are fixed. If I top a certain number on my bank account, a good part of the surplus will be donated.

I believe it's right to devote a large portion of your wealth to helping others. I plan to do this at some stage, but haven't put the necessary thought in yet. Part of the reason is that I'm not particularly financially secure, since all my income is from casual work.

I donate at least 10% each year because I've taken the Giving What We Can pledge and I think using my money to help others is extremely important. The amount I'm donating might go up significantly this year as I might earn a lot more (and consider donating a larger %)

Canâ€™t donate much right now, compared to how much Iâ€™ll be able to donate in a few years

In 2017 I was pursuing the earn to give strategy but I was also supporting 3 adult members of my family. I have switched this year to working for a non-profit organisation and now earn Â£20,000 and still fully support one adult family member so my donation plans have had to adjust accordingly

I'll donate everything above what seems better spent on my own minimal living expenses.

Currently a student so completely dependant on my parents

Plan to ramp up from a couple % to 20% donation once I have a full-time job (hopefully in the next few years or so).

To donate a minumum of 10%, percentage rising with my income, then leave the majority of my estate to effective causes when I die.

Saving to buy a house right now, which is reducing donations

I am currently a university student and do not have a full time job

If I get a windfall, I intend to donate a portion of that to EA causes

Ich tend to save money and thanks Spende Vera signifikant amounts in own projects.

Currently stable at 10000 euros per year, may step it up if I start earning more.

Aim to minimise tax, with a mixture of pension and charity. In the long-run almost everything goes to charity - it feels like the rest is just a matter of accounting.

As I am going to work in Germany I plan to donate more due to tax incentives.

Iâ€™m a student in college and am looking to donate more once i get a full time job

I'm a graduate student with little money to spare. But once I have a real job (not a post-doc), I plan to take the Giving What We Can pledge of donating 10% of my salary.

I pledged to donate 10%

## improve_ea_comment  ##



I like to group our donations into categories. Our categories are community (housing, arts, health, etc.) and environment (climate change, animals, ocean, etc.), further divided into local/state and national/global. Each year, we first decide how much to give in total dollars and how much to allocate to each of the four quadrants percentage-wise. Then we decide which charities to give to and how much to give to each charity within the allocations. (Most of the numbers of course don't change much from year to year.) I believe such a framework would help a lot of people be more methodical and effective in their altruism.

Ensuring more diversity and focusing more on making people excellent and able to do a lot of good with their time and money rather than just trying to find people who are already excellent and able.

Mental health problems seem to be more a problem in the EA community and the "do the most good" mindset can interact poorly with that. Better strategies for dealing with this would be good.

More outreach in a way that is palatable to mainstream organizations

Less acronyms, more simple English

Improve on the diversity problem and reach out to people who aren't in the more prevalent demographics

Try to match opportunities to goals, rather than assuming everyone shares in one set of goals.

Focus more on local communities being inclusive to get people "in"

I think the EA community should focus less on deifying ideas and philosophizing. For how good EA ideas/philosophies are, I find we get painfully little done (or rather, a few people get a lot done and a lot of people don't do much). I'd like to see EA take a more intuitive/wholistic approach to talent management, and be more open to recruiting and "converting" smart, normal, high-functioning people to work on high-impact causes. Additionally, I think some of the ways we talk about impact, career choice, and donating are somewhat toxic and actively bad for community mental health. In some ways I think we should be pushing people to be more well-rounded and value a wider range of skills than we currently do.

be more humble, don't encourage people to pretend to be more utilitarian than they actually are, kick out the toxic lesswrongers and ssc people (ie all of them), they're really racist

Chill the fuck out. Have fun. Have kids.

Don't let anyone signal how much they've donated by putting that information in public display

Better continued engagement with people to reduce attrition. More openness to new causes. More funding opportunities for fledgling efforts.

Have good, kind, endearing, smart, faces of the movement so people can better connect with who seems to be running important initiatives.

Be less hardcore utilitarian? Not because utilitarianism is necessarily wrong, but because it's off-putting. E.g. global utility probably increases if I donate 100% of my income and live in squalor. I don't want to do that. But if the argument for "donate some" is it increases global utility even at slight but nonzero cost to my own, doesn't that same argument apply?

be more inclusive/engaging with local people in person.  Perhaps that's not an issue in general but in Seattle, if you're not downtown the local team has no interest in engaging with you.  This is not just my opinion.  I have spoken to others on the Eastside and everyone seems to have the same perspective

Pressure non-profits to BE NON-profit, not pay their CEOs more than $200,000, for starters.

Stronger focus on fun / making the community something which makes its members happier (which will let us attract and retain more high quality people)

Yes: Life coaching of some kind directly specifically at EAs. 80K career coaching is currently trying to help EAs do more good through career choice. CFAR is helping EAs try to reduce x-risk by making them more rational. These are the only two examples I can think of in this category. I believe the EA community is lacking better life coaching in general for EAs. There are some very intelligent and altruistic-at-the-core people in EA who for whatever reason are not competent enough in all areas of living to flourish entirely on their own. I believe it would be a highly-effective thing for the EA community to work together to help these people live their best EA lives.

Let people link up their CanadaHelps.org accounts with their EA profile.

I'm somewhat concerned that there's a hierarchical division whereby certain people who have been in it for a while or have leadership positions may allow this to go to their heads and fail to treat other EAs with an appropriate level of respect and consideration.

1) Spreading the movement    2) Thinking about systemic change in political systems as a means of achieving EA ends. Not all of EA can be a-political    3) Finding ways to capitalize on empathy, rather than highlighting need for rationality

Don't measure just human lives. That's the cause I feel is less important than the overall health of the planet.

Access educational resources on colonialism, imperialism, racism and it's lasting effects on those we try to help on how we think. Our approaches and perspectives are NOT neutral, but we think they tend to be because of this major blindspot in our community.

Come down harder on bigoted comments. There are islamophobic posts and also borderline racist posts in EA facebook groups

Post more or approve more posts in the bigger EA Facebook groups. Seems to be too little discussion.

More exposure

Messaging, Community, Onboarding, and Communication. There are tons of smart, caring, technically minded individuals who are working on important problems within/through EA. But that doesn't matter if enrollment is lacking because 90% of the discussion is relatively contextless to newcomers and there's no effective system for getting people into the funnel.     There's a major opportunity to go directly to schools and teach this stuff IMO. That's the exact point at which people are shaping their identities and deciding on narratives that will shape their future decisions, esp regarding their work.

- More active recruitment  - Reach out to the mass media  - Consider reaching out to working class people (i.e: career guides for non-graduates covering blue collar professions such as plumbing)

I'm worried that EA orgs submit to pressure to be politically correct and tries to forcefully diversify by not hiring the best candidates but instead discriminating based on gender, race or similar attributes in order to have more "equal" distribution of employees.    In general I'm worried that short-term political issues are given too much attention over long-term causes.

Cgp grey video? One with disclaimers that it requires thinking about.

Some 80k-style coaching available for people who haven't got a world-top-20 graduate degree, e.g. me. Just a little bit would be nice, I probably have tons of blind spots when it comes to career planning that someone else might be able to cover.

No

More community based events in SF specifically (as opposed to the rest of the bay area).

Be more inviting for lower income non college graduates

Shut the fuck up about vegetarianism

Efforts towards greater media attention - not only have I never seen reference to EA in New Zealand media but neither have I seen any to EA-aligned charities despite charities often featuring.

I think the strategy of putting forward the most contrarian aspects of EA (earning to give most notably) is very detrimental to the movement to the extent that it antagonizes a lot of reasonable leftist people. I would like to see the movement try to appeal to the lowest common denominator and not always aim to create a super woke self-referential elite

I suspect we think too highly of ourselves, and need to try harder to build credibility with non-EAs. Separately, I suspect we underpay people at EA organizations.

Try not to be exclusive.

The main proponents seem to be high-IQ Ivey league scholars and that makes me feel like I cannot contribute beyond Earning to Give.

improve image of effective altruism such that people will think effective altruists are very good people - the best kind. I think this is necessary as people are not motivated to just do good for people, they are motivated be the idea that others will think better of them for it. if we want to do the most good, we could attract the most people to do it by fixing this problem.

Work on making donation suggestions for organisations in various countries - people often choose which organisations to make donations to depending on whether they are tax deductible, and in some countries only donations to certain organisatikns are deductible

Personal interactions and relationships are generally treated as far less important than the Pursuit of Truth, which has lead to EA being a far less enjoyable community to be a part of than other communities. I have good relationships with individual EAs but it's a fantastically challenging group to introduce new people into.     I rated mental health lower on the priority list than some other priorities, but mental health and EQ within the EA community should be a high internal priority.

Supporting individuals more that are working at universities / hosting local meet ups

-> Better at individual outreach within the movement, as many high potential EAs are not actually moving beyond minimal engagement and there are no clear paths towards higher engagement    -> Better at inclusive outreach outside the movement, as the current demographics of the movement are very highly skewed (likely due to spread through social networks)    -> Better coordination between the central/top organizations, as both duplicative efforts and differing approaches can harm the movement's efficiency.     -> Better transparency in decision making for the central/top organizations, as current practices can be somewhat vague and can result in distrust of the movement as a whole.

Think deeper about global human history, in particular the nature of authoritarian inheritance and colonialism, and the resulting problem of the birth lottery.

Increase focus on older donors and issues around handling wealth and inheritance.

More tools to engage with the public

Care more about exploited animal suffering and wild animal suffering.

More broadly approachable. Less intellectual. Use less complicated terms for communication.

Recognise more its political situatedness. Currently I have the impression that EA pretends to be very apolitical, and just a collection of free individuals donating the money they accidentally have more of because of market failures, while failing to consider the embedded need for inequalities within the current political economic system, and the ways in which suggesting that donations can solve the problem only perpetuate and legitimise it.

Epistemically

tips for salary negotiations and mechanisms to donate more with lower tax burden.  Help setting up giving matching with organizations. Tools, ice breakers, and conversation topics to help local GWWC members socialize.

Less focus on direct political action, more focus on encouraging people to think critically about helping people effectively

Focus on poverty- well being of others.

Be more emotional and empathetic rather than ultra-rational.

Be more welcoming and less aggressive in facebook group commentaries. Also, posts would be more interesting for the broad community if they were better explained: most of them use such a specific language that it is hard to engage

Disseminate ideas:  Against Empathy - Paul Bloom  Ethical Consumer (UK Magazine)

More university groups - the one at Warwick University, whilst small, has helped me a lot

Less Social Justice. Social Justice is not compatible with effective altruism since it is fundamentally not about prioritizing the objectively most important issues. SJ is also incompatible with epistemic rationality.

Advertise jobs much more widely- by giving them to people already in the community you only increase the group-think, which can be fairly prevalent.

More moral seriousness.  Take our ideas seriously.

Fewer men being bullish

You put too great an emphasis on charitable giving as opposed to Good works. It seems you are looking for $

Become more diverse.  Become less focused on ai. While we're faffing about with ai, people are still dying of malaria. I think the interest in ai reflects the fact it's an interesting subject, and is not the result of serious cause prioritization.

There seems to be a lot of personal drama and backbiting among longstanding community members who are close to the social center, which plays out in fora like Facebook and on various people's blogs. Fortunately I haven't had to deal with it much myself, but it's discouraging to watch from afar and makes me less enthusiastic about participating or identifying as an EA.

no

developing metrics for important yet fuzzy charity work, e.g. fostering democracy and community participation

Less certainty. More diversity. More listening and less telling.

Nobody should be working on global poverty or animal welfare right now, except possibly for signaling purposes. The long-term future of both poor humans and animals is almost completely determined by the behavior of human civilization as a whole in general and the most influential living humans in particular. The most extreme version of this story is the one in which the long-term future of both poor humans and animals is almost completely determined by AGI.

Most people I speak to (baby boomers) have never heard of EA. Iâ€™m not sure how to fix this. Social media, mainstream media, tv ????

We should remain cause neutral and put the breaks on prioritising AI

Get rid of the AI obsession

See stuff mentioned in causes priorities  Not qualified to say, very marginally attached to the community at the moment, will pry become more involved once fixed my career

allow for value of network effects

Consider placing more emphasis on growing the EA movement, promoting EA ideas, and improving the critical thinking skills of the general public.

Put more resources towards building an inclusive movement, be less focussed around a small number of high status individuals.

The primary reason I don't get involved is that EA communities primarily value things that rank pretty low on my return per dollar scale.  There's not a lot for me to talk about with them.

I would perhaps like to be able to receive more guidance for Arts students and their prospective careers.

More events on and off campuses

Help local organizers to better asses whats valuable and what's not when organizing a local group. Overhead and admin time is really expensive

Tone down the â€˜EA-nessâ€™ sometimes to engage with a wider audience. For example, I find giving what we canâ€™s message is generally uncontreversial when I talk to people, but some of the AI ex-risk stuff tends to alienate people

It would be helpful for me personally if there was more emphasis on things I could do without being full-time EA/completely uprooting my career/doing local outreach work I am not suited to/etc. Always being recommended the same 3 careers I can't do is kind of depressing.  These things make EA feel more like Obligation even when you try to emphasize the Opportunity framing in other contexts. The effect on me is that I feel like I have to do EA against my will, which is obviously not good; it also makes outreach feel like I'm luring people into a trap (and it doesn't help that the official goal of local groups is supposed to be to get promising people to go Full EA; this is not the kind of commitment people sign up for when they join a local meetup group).

A little more outreach; stronger recommendation on its conclusions, if I am to understand that the charities listed above are truly the only ones to bother with. Maybe a tiny bit less focus on very high achievers (income), or interviews with less than very high achievers on their involvement

This is just based on my very limited experience, but it seems to suffer from narrow demographics. Lots of systematising types (maths, physics, engineering, computer science, etc.). Not enough social scientists, or other backgrounds for that matter.    The way rationality is handled also worries me a bit. I feel that only a pretty low bar of rationality is actually needed, but the movement seems to focus on extreme levels of sophistication in rationality techniques. I suspect this leads to rapidly diminishing returns (above a low threshold, more rationality is hard to obtain and doesn't give much in return), a lack of resources for other things, and possibly a kind of hubris (rationality is set up as some ultimate answer to all problems, when in fact it's often near useless compared to specific expertise in a domain). Extreme rationality may also be off-putting to many people who I expect would otherwise be right on board with the general idea of EA.    I may be way off with all this - just my impressions/speculations.

Yes lots    The crux of them come down to the fact that EA should exist to help people get good at doing good but is both failing to achieve that and not clearly heading in the right direction. Particular flaws are:    - very limited scope to research on how to do good. Eg 80k only looks as how to do good in early career. What about the next 50 years?    - too utilitarian. Not utilitarians want to do good too.    - not enough focus on making EA better and of use to everyone. If EA was a product we'd be trying to sell it while it is still a bit shit rather than trying to improve it.    - off-puttingly undiverse.    - not enough exploration entrepreneurship    On a different track there is also a lack of focus on improving policy and politics and systemic issues.

less focus on "effective altruist" identity and "effective altruism" as a movement.    more willingness to engage in how to be effective across a broader array of causes (not needing to abandon cause prioritization). See GiveWell's post on disaster relief recommendations for good example.

The effective altruism community could be more open and welcoming towards people coming from under-represented backgrounds, such as lower and middle class people of color.

Tell more people about the ideas of effective altruism, and resources available to people who want to increase their positive impact on the world. I think a large number of people would be interested in our message, but we are too reticent in our spreading of the message.

More diversity

Worry a lot more about negative feed back from social justice communities. In my experience the more gung-ho people are about Social Justice, the less they like EA when they hear about it. I could see EA being destroyed because of them, despite not having mutually incompatible objectives.

_Ÿê™_Ÿ_©

Being more inclusive of people who are not capable / willing to engage on a highly intellectual level of discourse    Being more critical of mostly rational/abstract ways of conceiving of important issues within EA (eg value, suffering, truth,...)    Being more critical of the philosophical/methodological foundations used to make judgements within EA

Stated previously, but we need some liaisons to the community who can help learn how to get these ideas into the mainstream. I find the community a bit extreme / homogeneous (young, idealistic, far left, highly educated, hyper rational, open minded) and bridges need to be built to where the donation $ are (old, center-left to right, set in ways, concern for prestige, possibly less educated and rational).

Pay great attention to what statisticians who research the replication crisis say. They seem to be far more concerned than the general social scientist while probably being more important to listen to. Very important to get our research right, and that may be harder than we think (as it seems to me but not sure).  The Facebook group "Psychological Methods Discussion Group" is a great resource with some top-notch experts eager to talk about it.

We should focus on research and discussing our ideas, instead of focusing on money and donations.

create a list of top charities to donate to groups by cause

The EA community in general enjoys a lot of privilege, seeks out more (recruiting largely from elite schools, earning to give, etc.) and has a lot of trouble opening the community to people who do not share their general age, sex, gender identity, ethnicity, race, level of formal education, socio-economic status, or ability.

Be more open to a diverse range of perspectives and ideas about causes and measuring efficacy, etc. Do not try so much to push people and community discourse down specifically narrow lines set by leading EA orgs.  Encourage EAs and EA orgs to engage more with existing academics, charities, and government aid programs to improve their efficacy and focus, rather than 'reinventing the wheel'.  Renew efforts and emphasis on functioning as a mass movement to try to shift community norms and ideas about charity and giving, rather than focusing largely on recruiting a small number of potentially high impact students and young professionals to work in EA orgs.  More transparency from main EA orgs (e.g. 80,000 hours, CEA, MIRI, etc) about what they do and what they use funds for.

Stop pressuring people into the EA fad of the day. Itâ€™s good to explain why you think DA is great or whatever, but when I want to rethink my career choices, I will go talk to 80k hours myself; I donâ€™t need people to constantly offer to â€œchat about DA operations workâ€ù

Move away from the start up/entrepreneur ideal. Promote using existing political and social infrastructure to do good rather than promoting doing a brand new good thing.

It can be easy to get stuck on the margins, especially if you don't live in a city that has a strong EA community that meets a lot. My EA involvement has been greatly aided by a few specific EAs that talked with me. Other movements have the concept of one-to-ones; people who are new get paired up with more experienced community members to help them figure out the best ways to get involved and connected to the community. Without that, my sense is that in the Bay area (where I lived) the EA community was split fairly dramatically, with a small core of actively involved people and no way to enter it.    Also- my limited in person EA experiences have given me the sense that there is a weird gender dynamic in many EA communities.

Uh more love for us close to average-IQ folks?

More reflexivity with local groups about internal biases

be careful about not overestimating the importance of rationality

Look at ADVERTISING campaigns that have worked for less effective charities/organizations, which receive unjustified amounts of money through donation. Consider how they appeal to the publicâ€™s affinity for storytelling and inclination to empathize with victims of certain problems (e.g. cancer, hurricanes, etc.).

I have noticed that EA tends to be quite a top-down focused organization when analyzing what solutions are best. I may be wrong in that characterization, since I am only tangentially involved with the org., but if I am not, then I recommend looking for more community-based and "grassroots" localized problem analyses and solutions, because oftentimes top-down planning does not actually address or even exacerbates existing problems. I.E. go out and talk to the people in the communities you see problems in to get their understanding of the problems and listen to what they have to say. They may be wrong in some cases, but they often know the local area better than you do, so you can get good info from them either way. If you need help learning how to work with local communities that may be suspicious of outsiders, I recommend reading "Rules for Radicals" by Saul Alinsky...it provides advice for how to do those things, among other advice that is good to know too. Anyways, I wish y'all the best of luck with solving problems and helping people out, alons-y!

Get more people involved, do and promote more research

Less focus on sexy speculative causes like AI as an existential risk

Highlighting that EA members should consider causes that receive high amounts of donations compared to those with no or little ability to attract donations. Recognise that effectiveness figure does not take into account all factors e.g. giving directly to a community rather than a US based charity may have a higher impact, big does not always mean more effective despite the economies of scale - one size does not fit all

Yes

focus an order of magnitude more resources on local causes (building the EA/LW community itself, fostering local community Ã©Å§Ã§Â°

fund my machine learning startup!    less joking, stop wasting everyone's time with the vegetarianism bullshit. provide meat at events and I might start coming to them again - not because I can't get meat other ways, but because bowing to vegetarians when it was supposed to be about highest impact is really irritating and reeks of the social disease that killed progressive effectiveness in the past 10 years.

I wish 80,000 Hours expanded beyond the Ivy League, or at least tweaked their messaging to be more inclusive. There are impact-driven people from public schools too, and I think the community should try to target these people. Even if organizations don't have the resources to go in person, consider creating more online content.    In particular, 80,000 Hours had an article talking about the importance of getting in to a top tier university. Most EAs I imagine are already past this point of applying for undergrad, so I think it's fine to keep that point but make sure it includes all people.    I gave this suggestion to them last year.

Make it more including and welcoming for women. Including language (for instance the sentence below "put myself in his shoes" is male-centered), sexual harassment, being aware of the influence from some of the sexist rationalist movements, understanding and prioritizing women's rights as a global issue. I am disappointed in EAs non-involvement in these things and it has driven me away from being involved.

I support incorporating 'sign me up for newsletters' and 'make/update a profile' into the survey. Small steps like that leveraged to remove trivial inconveniences.

Less millennial attitude and arrogance from some members of the community would be great.

It feels quite insular. It could also be more diverse.

To also focus on helping creating and directing for-profit companies to do good

more centralised platform to learn about the range of charities not limited to focused causes by the community leaders. more in-depth analysis of charities. more self-critical analysis/work to improve ones process/thinking..

Some democratization of key representative posts would be nice.

Better communication between local chapters and a little control over them, so that they don't get derailed by cultish power-people who drive newcomers away.     Also, try really hard to not overdo the guilt tripping, and reduce overdemandingness. I know it's a fine line between creating a helpful social obligation and overdoing it with the pressure, but I know at least two people who don't associate with EA anymore because of (mostly philosophical) overdemandingness anxiety. (Like, "will I ever do enough" and resulting depression)

1. Improve diversity. Whilst I broadly agree with "The Importance of Amazing People" (https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/effective-altruism-community-building) I worry that we will exclude people and be unwelcoming. Some members of the community seem way too confident in their own ability to recognise "amazing people". I think there's a real risk of this being catastrophic for EA.    2. I think transparency is very important and occasionally some EA organisations don't do well enough.

Create an app which has good news, funny videos, holidays, activities, etc. Etc. All based around EA.  People will love it and it will be so refreshing from all the depressing news.  If you out all the happy, good news stuff in the main part of the app and then have a button saying 'get involved' and then behind that button have the hard facts of where help is needed further ... But only if the user presses the button.  If the user just wants to see how the world is improving and have a good smile / chuckle then the user should be able to do that without feeling depressed!

Find more ways to connect with lurkers in the communities, make support groups more obvious, create an open culture that better promotes psychological safety (in order to boost the likelihood of interaction of lurkers)

I'd love an expansion of GiveWell's way of making it easy to donate. Ideally I'd like to rank order my values and trust GiveWell or a similar party to assign my donation to charities according to these preferences. I may be a minority, but I am really not that interested in evaluating causes or charities myself, and would much rather trust a professional to do this right.

Have a lower key version for lay people - some people aren't as into the details, but they just need to know that the right intention is behind it and that they trust the people working on it. There seems to be a large cognitive overhead to get through the information available on the organisations involved. Perhaps a survey that helps decide which organisations I should contribute to (now that I think about it, I assume this already exists but is washed out in the noise of all the other information available).

none

More women and minorities on the online foras.  More predictability and reliability from CEA and other central organisations.

Be less cult like. There's some vibe about it that puts me off it. It's a very pressuring environment and makes individuals feel like they're being used in some utilitarian scheme. This might be the optimal method of extracting utility from people who start feeling guilty about it. But maybe it'd be better or more ethical to attempt to at least not have that image and vibe.

Be more aware on how we present ourselves to others. Most already do a pretty good job, but still.     Hold ourselves to higher epistemic and rational standards.   Don't be *too* accepting of shitty views like speciesism. Maybe think more about a rebranded Normie-EA which is purely donations and poverty. Okay, I'm not thinking this through but it seems there are more views than should be correct out there.

Do not close the community too much, get more feedback from the outside.  Focus on what are the actual people's terminal values. Is it really the number of lives saved? (I know it's not for me)

The EA community sometimes has an intellectual elitist air about it. The groups tend to be very technical for the lay person (who is acting out of compassion and rationality) to easily digest. Therefore, it may help to somehow have separate spaces for high level and low level EA discussions, due to being very overwhelming for an "average" person to engage in.    There is a strong connection with veganism - which probably attracts quite a lot of people but would also detract others. On balance, I like the veganism links, but I can see how it may perturb others.

Going beyond philanthropy a bit more (:

I think we could admit where we overlap with other communities advice. For example, many people have been arguing for a long time ideas similar to EA's on existential risk e.g. nuclear weapon safety. We seem to feel a need to claim to have a new perspective on everything though, when often it is just a new vocabulary. This makes us seem arrogant and potentially prevents us connecting with people for whom we fundamentally agree.

Improve your presence outside english-speaking countries. I feel EA is very underground or barely existing altogether around here.

I would welcome democratic decision making in the EA community, not just surveys.     More than just a few people seem only to be interested in the EA-potential of people and not really in their personality. This is dangerous because it makes one feel arranged for instruments.    Support also female culture in the movement.     Veganism is a great thing. Yet, EA and veganism are not the same thing. Make carnivores feel welcome, too.    But, all in all, EAs have a great effect onto our world and its sentient beings! Thanks!

Helping people choose effective charities in an area they find important

The philosophy of EA is a reflection of the philosophy in STEM, which is absolutely abysmal. The fact that EAs tend to see ethics as various forms of utilitarianism vs deontology is laughable. The EA community needs more people who are well read in and hold a broad range of views in philosophy, and can see beyond the stilted *systems* that EA is so fond of, and have introspective access to the gears that let us understand the good.

I'd never heard of this community until very recently. Perhaps getting more people aware it exists. One simple way to do this, would just be to tell people to tell others about this.

Talent gaps are something you can spend money to solve.  Given how much people talk about talent gaps being more important than funding gaps, it's odd how few people are working on bridging those gaps (e.g. at top universities)

Maybe an online course for local group community builders would be nice, e.g. to walk one through using the CEA, EA Hub, and Forum platforms... all of which I spent a lot of time on milling around and reading (a coherent path could have been nice, though of course, it should allow for lots of openness and branching and distraction #stay-curious).

Study the humanities more, especially history and continental philosophy.   Generally increase diversity of experiences & types.  Deal with issues around social status - maybe stop thinking about social status so much.

More work on adapting/creating EA material fit to local cultures (in my case, French)

I'd kind of like more of a focus on disease eradication since secures and removes entire potential sources of future suffering, even if getting the number of guinea worm or polio cases down to zero may be resource intensive for a relatively small present benefit.

It would be nice for me if it had less of an aura of elitism about it, but I am not sure there are good ways to reduce this that would turn out well on consequentialist grounds.    Overall I like the community quite well.

Better explanations of why/what your aims are. Some of your literature is confusing.

Better reach out

Spread   Effectively   To other countries/continents  Looking for the way to be also a movement in every particular way.

I might be mistaken, but I don't feel the community speaks nearly as much to me.  I now have a partner, mortgage, kids, an established career ... I've got less scope to revisit things from a blank slate perspective, and much less time to devote to thinking things through. Probably also a lot of baggage! I'm not as sure that there are resources in the community for mid life pivots in giving, career choices etc.

More thought about EA and climate change.

Facebook dialogue could be more civil.  I also personally need to find a better way to advocate for effective altruism without sounding like my donation opinions are necessarily superior to others.

No I Don't. Your doing Quito ok.

Target the rich. It is wonderful to have space travelling and billions spent in the luxury industry when half of the world has no money for food or shelter and middle class in the developed world is being squeezed.

I find the focus on existential questions somewhat bizarre and detracting from more effective work that could be done.  (Just my opinion.)

I tend to see significant dismissal of leftist politics from the EA community - while such politics should be criticized to the extent that they may not be effective, of course, the EA community would do well to bear in mind that addressing the symptoms of flawed economic structures (i.e. poverty) is not mutually exclusive with addressing root causes.

Have follow-up 80,000 Hour career coaching meetings every once in a while. A lot changes even over the course of a year.

actually focus more on the fundamentals of encouraging EA rather than on some sort of secondary characteristics, such as diversity or even "community"

Less focus on AI

Solve the "You should work for an EA org" ... "You have been rejected from the EA org" problem.

The community still feels highly insular, and I find it odd that the gender ratios are skewed male. (Albeit, that's an anecdotal observation.) Don't have any specific recommendations, but a focus on opening up the community is needed.

Randomly kill pseudorational white cis brodudes infecting the EA community

More help with local group expansion.

Reporting resultsâ€”without spinâ€” facts, figures, and narratives.   Tell how many others have joined the cause and what they are doing.

Pay attention to the mental health of community members

(Sorry, hadn't seen this question when I made the earlier comment!)    It's really crucial that we do more to change the perception of EA as white and male. I've had too many conversations with people who have been put off by this and decided not to get more involved because of it.

Be more interested in epistemic rationality than mass appeal, be more about reducing suffering than saving lifes.

Never compromise truth seeking for short-term gains.

(I'm erring on the side of mentioning too many things. They might apply to only parts of the community, if at all.)    - Generally become less insular, interface more with and learn from the non-EA world, e.g. academia, industry ...    - Better understand how decision-making in organisations and institutions most relevant to the future of transformative AI works in practice, e.g. leading AI companies, governments (esp. national security, technology policy, ...). Perhaps by advising more EAs to work in these institutions.    - Produce both more thorough and more accessible content on esoteric/weird topics which might still harbor crucial considerations, e.g. how the axiological value of the universe depends on which cosmological theory is true, how to think about acausal trade or multiverse-wide cooperation, infinite ethics, ... [Tbc, I think extremely few people should work on this.]    - Have a non-hostile discussion about the community's lack of diversity, if and why it's a problem, and what to do about it. This can only work if all sides acknowledge that this is not a one-sided issue and that both worries about a lack of diversity and worries about harming epistemic norms by arguing or pushing for diversity in certain ways are prima facie reasonable and something that can legitimately be expressed without being yelled at or downvoted.    - Stop using Peter Thiel and Elon Musk as examples of impressive people, at least if not joined by other examples. (Why? (i) Some people outside of Silicon Valley might not even have heard of them, or at least might not be sufficiently familiar with their work. (ii) I'm not aware of any well argued case that what they did is objectively impressive by standards generally endorsed by the EA community. (iii) They are too similar [e.g. both entrepreneurs in tech], which IMO suggests an overly narrow view of what counts as impressive.)

I'd like us to be less overconfident/elitist/nepotistic in organizing the community. There are lots of people with fascinating things to say about EA, yet (for example) EAG seems more focused on the organizers getting their friends and colleagues prestigious speaking gigs.

Stronger outreach efforts at universities. Personally for me, some specific career advice for Physics students, beyond just earning to give would be appreciated.

Logistically, no. I personally would just like to see more focus on suffering reduction, as opposed to e.g., lives saved. Torture-like experiences are worse than death IMO.

Needs better PR to engage people emotionally, and not come across as cold and calculating  Needs to make links between EA and existing charitable organisations / movements (e.g. religions)  Needs to think more long term about EA growth and culture change

Be less elitist and more diverse/inclusive.

EA strikes me as comically ineffective, since it seems to attempt to apply local optimization solutions to problems that are globally complex. CFAR teaches "tilting the landscape" to create change, and it seems EA is much more "forcefully pushing the boulder up the hill" by aggregating financial resources. To solve the problems EA actually wants to solve, I think it would help to zoom out and understand the larger picture and the incentive structures that all people actually operate under.

Try to please "hidden motives" as well when spreading the word (see your podcast with Robin Hanson).

I would like to connect to community & hear of opportunities to do so.

The in-person experiences I have had of effective altruists have been 99% positive. But I think the online community is somewhat different. It's not actively hostile or anything, but there is a lot of in-group jargon that often feels unnecessary and potentially alienating to new people.    There is a general concern I have that EA organisations are self-publishing research that hasn't undergone peer-review, and it is not clear to me how much weight we should actually give research. I appreciate that the Global Priorities Institute will hopefully be one way of getting more peer-reviewed EA literature published.

More supportive/welcoming of disagreements about what matters. Less combative.

Come up with more possibilities to work on EA causes remotely

I think choices regarding outreach shouldn't be ruled so much by fear of the potential negative consequences. I think those in a position to have any influence over outreach should be working out how to do it better and following through accordingly, as opposed to easing up on it altogether.

Finding a way around the initial "weirdness" factor?

Stop being so concerned about monetary donations. Sure, they help but they don't MEAN anything.

Having a greater overhead dedicated to advertising for the purpose of multiplying donations and trying to get the public to accept the idea of such use of donations.

Reduce the cultural influence of the rationalist community within EA.

Stop using donations to promote EA, start actually helping!

Outreach - the EA community feels quite insular, on a large scale. It seems that the news of EA spreads purely on a small scale, through word of mouth. I think the effectiveness of a large EA awareness campaign should be considered, so that effective altruism can become more of a 'house-hold name', in the same way that other social movements are.

would love to see more collegiate youth outreach to help folks incorporate EA into their career plans

It's unclear. I think EA might benefit from attempting to gain mass support, but I've seen strong arguments against this, such as diluting the movement, a reduction in per capita impact etc.    At the same time, I think EA could do with moving away from the (unsaid) doctrine of "brains before all". This makes EA exclusionist and elitist, and perhaps in our rush to try and do the most good as quickly as possible, we're blind to worlds where we do the more good by actually having more people contributing towards that good. We need more people who will mentor, who will train and engage in the cognitive development and enlightenment of those who just cannot learn it all on their own by grokking EA Forums and LessWrong.    There are additional benefits from altering the brand of EA to be more inclusive, and not only for the super geniuses among us. I suspect some people joining the movement, after a while, feel _as if_ they are smarter and perhaps cognitively more capable (Dunning-Krueger) than they actually are, because of the background noise that implicitly or explicitly says that EA is for smart people: if I managed to join and be a part of the community, I must be hot stuff! Sadly, this also sets up the expectation for these folks that they should take on high prestige cognitively challenging work (e.g. research), rather than perceived low-brain work like operations; meanwhile, EA orgs are facing a crunch in ops  capacities.

It's ridiculously rationalistic, indeed to a degree that I wonder how many people in there would understand what I meant â€“ or not write this off as a trivially ignorant thought.

Need to get high-profile people talking about it so it's more in the overton window. So far, it seems less talked about than friendly AI even, but maybe that's just what I see.

less association with MIRI unless they provide sufficient evidence of effectiveness (efficiency?)

I think the EA brand is becoming toxic to some policymakers, activists, and policy analysts we would like to influence.     Similarly, I think we could inject a focus on evidence and rigorous thinking (including under lots of uncertainty) into policy conversations more effectively by making our language and communication styles more inclusive and accessible.

Make some animated short videos about effective altruism. Get a coursera course about EA

I believe it would be easier to enter the effective altruism community if there was a sort of map of texts one could read in order to understand the movement and it's current situation.

More understanding of the impact scope of social, emotional intelligence, empathy and compassion.    More understanding about where the need for saving/ expanding life is coming from, and why it's (un-)reasonable to follow. Hint: What the paper clip is for a dangerously misguided AI, seems to be life for the EI (evolution driven intelligence).    Understanding that a rational, compassionate elite will not be able to influence irrational, un-compassionate masses. That's why I think proper education of the masses is undervalued.

Publish a set of canonical guides about the most effective way to do X, e.g. "the most effective way to fight climate change", "the most effective way to help animal rights", etc. Include a set of common behaviors people believe are important that are actually not effective

Engage with the large proposition of the public (in the uk at least) who think charities donâ€™t work/arenâ€™t effective

be more focused on altruism as a way of life, not just numbers, though numbers are important of course

I would encourage the founding of a spin-off movement for the lay person, where not philosophical/ethical topics dominate the agenda (with a somewhat elitist touch), but just the results of the research for effective giving. Somewhat like "the life you can save" is doing. This is totally absent in central Switzerland and there ist just the effective altruism movement which is still really small, however in a wealthy country in central europe it could be more effective to actually host a platform for the avarage joe without scaring them off with philosophical topics etc. (just my opinion)

Broaden, or elaborate on the choice of 'quality adjusted life years' as a priority at the expense of other things, improve the EA conference to contain better learning lectures and opportunities, and a conference dinner to keep people together in addition to the excellent networking opportunities

Get more members!

I could not find any place to clarify why I left parts of questions 54 and 56 unanswered, this box seemed least inappropriate:  I do not get upset.  I do not shop.  I do not dine out.  I do not go to stores.

Appeal to a much broader demographic through major media and less intense/specific articles.

Survey is too long, I am losing interest

Yes, two. First, there is a strong degree of cliquishness in the community, which makes it hard for new people to come on board. This is both a general comment and a personal observation specific to EAA (animals). I work with a group that has been doing EAA (though not under that term) for about 20 years, but some do not consider us an EAA group. That experience has significantly influenced my opinion of the EA community and how open it is to people who have been doing the work for a longer time. Second, the language used by EAs is very exclusionary and should be both simplified and more inclusive.

I would like to be more active with my time but don't really know how to be. It would be great if there were more volunteer options - especially ones that helped people feel like part of a community. I think donating is a very individual activity and therefore doesn't make me feel so connected to the EA community.   I also thought an organisation like 80,000 hours that gives advice and looks into the best way to spend one's free/volunteer time could be really useful.    It would also be great if more charities outside of the US were evaluated. This would be helpful both for deciding where to donate to but also which organisations to get involved with for people living in other parts of the world. Unfortunately much of the current information/recommendations are not so useful if you're not in the US.  I would also especially appreciate more guidance on which organisations are worth donating to for people who place a high priority on the environment and climate change.  Finally, it would be great if it were possible to make tax deductible donations to more of the recommended charities through local EA organisations - as is already possible for a few charities via EA Australia and EA Germany/Switzerland.

More prominent central organization and leadership.

Try to be more open and diverse. Don't be an extension of LessWrong, don't (inadvertently) exclude Deontologists and Virtue Ethicists, focus on the things that we agree matter (saving lives, making life better, even helping animals), rather than things we don't (AI risk, helping wild animals).    Also, since I was just having a conversation about this: Promote deontological thinking because you, and humans more generally, suck at being consequentialist. An (mathematically/economically sophisticated!) EA friend argued against being a vegetarian because he couldn't translate eating meat into an effect on animal lives. 80,000 hours has advocated against going into medicine because it sees an immediate effect of taking another doctor's job, but not the effects that percolate. (A good proxy for the value of a doctor is the number of lives the doctor saves.) Deontology will help with these mistakes.

No

Explore short term catastrophic risks more seriously. For example the degradation of our media ecosystem and polarisation acting as a threat multiplier increasing the chance of war, and failure of democracy worldwide.

In efficiency when it comes to recruitment and screening for people fit in important possitions.

There are wonderful options for recurring automatic donations. These are great, but I do not use them because I seek out matching funds at the end of the year to donate to. If there was a way to have recurring donations matched, I would use the automatic method.

Less focus on the AI risk bit - esoteric and puts off people who might otherwise agree with the cause

Effective altruism is currently making the mistake of alienating potential contributors by presenting itself as a â€œclubâ€ù for the academic, economic, and ethical elite.     To do the most good, we should invite the masses to join the EA movement and dispel notions of superiority by providing the proper tools and resources for anyone to make a difference.     This core belief allows The Charity Experiment to eliminate barriers to entry by widening the scope of potential donors and engaging a larger segment of the total populationâ€”especially those who have never considered an EA-founded giving strategy.

improve ea funds frequency of donations   try and get more publicity and be less choosy and worried about the message being misinterpreted  stop using academic language and write shorter articles- I think the community seems to be too inward focused in its message

be less weird about donations so you don't alienate all the practitioners. instead of making trolley problem jokes and assuming we "already know best", acknowledge the tough moral decisions you are asking people to make. maybe make people grapple with those more. don't ignore systems.

Become more inviting towards people who are not "high potentials"

I think you should concentrate on effective tools transforming system errors that sustain the current suffering. And you really have to prioritize the big longterm threads of planetary boundaries.

Sometimes people on the Facebook groups are kind of horrible. Why are they like that? Can they just stop being like that please? It's weird and also really unwelcoming for the new people I see posting sometimes.

We could use a solid YouTube channel.

Cooperate more with initiatives outside most developed countries. (Poland has very strong movement but not very good finances.)

Is be less utilitarian an acceptable suggestion?    I see the reason behind effective altruism and am largely on board, but I am not completely convinced for a variety of reasons, including that effective altruism necessarily depends on not everyone focusing on the same thing. It also prioritises causes based primarily, if not solely, on number-crunching which feels very sterile.     However, 80,000 hours has one of the better approaches due to the highlighting of personal fit.

Make it more visible to the world! There are probably a lot of people that would love to join the community but don't know EA exists (I was one of those for many years).

Keep putting out concrete research about how much more effective some donations are than others. That's basically the reason why I donate at all.

Make it easy to look through charities by cause.  Also, have effective links between sites (GWWC linking to 80,000 hours, etc.)

I think some EA organizations have an ideal level of transparency, humility, and kindness (in terms of how their content and team members come across). I think other EA organizations do not, and it would be great if they could improve.     I think many individual EAs fall pray to the biases and vices that would naturally arise in a community with EA's values and ideas. This is normal and unavoidable, but I still think we should all constantly try to see these blindspots and reflect on ways in which we could be systematically erring.     An example would be being competitive, dismissive, skeptical, cold, or contrarian to an unhealthy and unuseful degree (ie to the point where it makes out thinking, decisions, and personality worse) in order to signal rationality, intelligence and impact potential, and hence gain EA status.

The CEA staff has not been very professional in my interactions with them.  For example, Iâ€™ve been stood up for scheduled calls, and my emails have not been responded to (despite the CEA initiating the interaction).  This has happened with multiple CEA staff members and erodes my confidence in the entire organization.

Get more in touch on street and in the medias with not EA People (only few people knew EA!).  Make good presentations and and share it. Organise Presentations and first contact Events about the basic of EA thinking in all bigger citys. Ask schools and Unis for include EA start lectures.

many.

Movement building. Even if we have to relax our stances to accept people. 10% of a million is greater than 100% of ten thosand.

Reduce boundaries between self-organized effective altruism groups. Create a mutual and common understanding of how to create a collective impact together. Raise awareness how individuals can contribute. Show that you want to make a difference that is motivated by a non-personal attitude. Do not allow space for Ego. Show that generosity is profitable. Create positive relationships. Put trustworthiness above everything else. Be a real role model.

Host more social events that could bring people in and have a good experience with the movement. I don't always want to go to a PhD lecture that makes me feel like I should be doing more, but I'm generally happy to have a small discussion over drinks or an activity that helps me realize my own hypocrisy and want to improve. And focus on small steps in the right direction more than the paralysis that comes with trying to find the absolute optimal path that could be 10,000X better than the second or third best. Everyone becoming 2X more charitable would be a substantial improvement.

If I donate money to safe somebody's life with bed nets, and I don't know that person, how do I know that he/she will not become a serial killer or anti-vaccine campaigner? I feel a lot better if I can influence the people I help, and make sure they also contribute positively to society. Is this irrational?

More tribalism. Better social interaction. More personhood. We should have associations. Fraternities/sororities.

Delete the Facebook page     Reduce exposure to the image of the rationalist movement     Convert a higher proportion of high achieving university students (better student societies)

Less focus on esoteric, artificial intelligence etc  Inclusion of other perspectives, voices, maybe some less academic...it all feels a bit oxbridge-centric...which makes it a bit inaccessible.

More focus on outreach. There is a lot potential out there.

I think we need to continue widening our circle of moral consideration. A lot of effective altruists have widened their circles, but more could do so. As time has gone on, the community has gone to less conventional cause areas, and I think we should continue this trend and move towards more 'objectively' important cause areas rather than ones in the overton window.

Reaching out to and interacting with more traditional nonprofit & NGO groups regularly to cross-pollinate ideas and strategies as well as recruit new members.

- focus more on the intense forms of suffering present at the moment or to be expected in the future (focus less on minor forms of suffering or even positive experiences unless they are instrumentally valuable to alleviate intense forms of suffering)  - try and organize the existing and emerging information more centrally (some register or sth) and keep it updated. Invest more in acessibility and structuring of information. I keep searching for stuff (on Facebook, blogs etc.) that I once read and that I can't find again  - try to include more existing fields of knowledge and people with existing expertise into EA  - focus less heavily on the English speaking countries. Not necessarily by doing all in different languages but by reaching countries / communities / people in other countries and setting up EA organizations there

It's squewed young and to high achievers/high fliers.  If you want to reach broader audience, need to overcome this.  I'm in my early 40s and feel very old at EA events.  I have talked to many of my relatives who are in their 70s and 80s about EA and they have all been very interested.  EA is missing out on opportunities!   Also, the veganism. This is detracts people.

Publish a BRIEF mission statement. Adopt a logo. Get a simple website.

Give very specific advice for local groups.   Being more cautious about AI risks (knowing that there's a lot of uncertainty around AI safety issues)  We need to look further at environmental issues (not only climate change but also biodiversity risks) as they would seriously undermine the utility of future generations.   We need to be aware of group thinking for problems such as AI safety. We might be in an echo chamber.

EA needs to quantify, use metrics and analyze them, but also respect the beliefs and values of altruists who don't want to be identified as utilitarian. Consider how to keep encouraging the best stewardship for the common good while also respecting ideals that are transcendent.

Generate more awareness of their existence  in the general public

Increase in strategy, increase in member support and community development, move towards a more unified vision.

An expansion of 80000 hours to include content specific to Scandinavian citizens.

More inclusiveness, more decentralised.

Be even nicer to each other and to yourselves. We are all fighting a hard battle.

Make sure you're reaching out to people of all economic statuses - people who've experienced economic hardship tend to be more generous (proportionally) than those with lifelong wealth. Grassroots donations add up quickly.

EA appears to have veered a bit hard to the AI x-risk cause. This seems related to its diversity problem â€” white, male, STEM, with a large SF contingent. As someone who is while, male, STEM, and lives in SF, I can understand wanting AI x-risk to be the most important cause. It probably aligns best with my skillset. It's clearly an important cause (hence my rankings), but it seems hard to me to prioritize it over other more well-developed x-risks, let alone global poverty and animal suffering, which are well understood and current.

1) Question the assumption that the future is very positive in expectation and that the best way to shape the far future is through x-risk reduction.   2) http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1g3/why_how_to_make_progress_on_diversity_inclusion/

I think we need to put more resources into US politics, influencing the national security establishment in particular. I think this is the best way to address many existential risk issues.

Be more welcoming of normal people living ordinary lives, rather than extremists trying to do the best possible thing they can.

I think there is too much focus on existential risks--though important, I think Steven Pinker's critiques were trenchant. Scenarios involving AI and the singularity are extremely speculative, and their weirdness might turn off people who are interested in global development.

Be better at anticipating future talent bottlenecks. Before we needed marketers and software developers, now it's ops and research. By the time some people have changed tack to be in line with these new priorities, the bottleneck won't be as much of an issue anymore and there will be a gap elsewhere. We've got to get better at predicting that.    Other thing is some serious introspection on the cult-like nature of EA. It isn't the be-all and end-all.    More support for people who feel like they're burning out (like myself) and feel less motivated by EA.    Philosophical discussions on the ethics of designating ourselves as some sort of saviours of humanity. Who are we to tell others what to think and do?

A lot of the EA content I see on the web are "rationality"-style articles that are rather technical and heavy with jargon. To me, these have given the feel that to participate in EA, you need to take it as a hobby and put in significant effort to be able to even follow the conversation and understand what EA is about. Personally, I likely would have started donating EA-style much earlier if I had had a steady stream of more easy-to-read-articles available, e.g., describing the developments in the community for "laypeople".

Be less judgmental and more inclusive

I think its pretty awesome but it could definitely use more gender and racial diversity, even if only for instrumental reasons. It is hard to recruit folks who aren't white dudes when most of the movement seems to be us.

educate themselves in a wide array of fields, especially the ones that are traditionally neglected by this community

Some kind of email list to spread the word if a time-sensitive monetary event is happening (e.g. like when Bill Gates offered to match the first $X donated on Facebook).

Communications can sometimes be a bit tone-deaf. Eg. recently got emailed a job ad from FHI specifying that they wanted someone "who has low susceptibility to mental health issues"    Less group-think. Encourage innovation. Encourage people to think hard about cause prioritisation and do their own research.

I'm aware my perceptions may be flawed but I sense a competetivness in EA that has lowered my self-efficacy in comparison to before. Sure we should be effective, but sometimes I feel like the most important thing is that you were entrepreneur enough, motivated by scaricity, be first and you get a place. I eg have now redirected to learn CS for maybe AI Safety if possible, but even tough that feels rational of me to change so much it will probably still be being first that mattered. Know more people who feel this way and don't speak up. Would be great with more coaches, etc, this is really tough decisions to take by yourself, esp when your live somewhere almost nobody understand you challenges with EA, no local EA group exists, etc. Maybe I should be a good smart EA and figure it out, but it's hard. :(

Don't lose sight of helping to end/reduce current suffering (although avoiding future suffering is still important)

Perhaps a little more public engagement with climate change

More diversity in thought leadership. More welcoming

There is an unpleasant sense of "betterness" amongst some EAs, which makes me not want to be more involved. Many EAs I've met are highly critical of the charity sector, but have had no or little experience in it and the daily challenges we face. As a result, while I subscribe to the fundamental ideas behind EA, I find the community very offputting.

Make it easier to find resources on how to balance donating with financial well-being.

Most of it comes down to the fact that many EAs are time poor and passion rich.    In which case it'd be helpful to have more guidance on running local groups that is brief, actionable and up to date. e.g. It can be a struggle to search for a resource that leads you to read a long forum post about a possible group activity to find out whether it's easy to run and effective (and get to the end and find out it's a dud). Small teams really benefit from basics that they can run with and structures that are easy to implement.    Some kind of CRM that helps us manage (and follow up with) new/old members between Facebook/Meetup/email etc.    Formal systems for peer accountability/coaching/mentoring so we can easily help each other to do better instead of people figuring it out on their own.    Look to what a lot of other successful movements have done. The Power of Habit has a good chapter on the way churches did it, so does another book I've read (I think it was "The Purpose Driven Church". Other ones on psychology like "Change Of Heart" are also helpful... sure there's many more I'm unaware of.

Get the following more under control:  - some online groups/forums  - hero worshipping  - elitism!!  - covert sexism/racism/stereotyping/bias  - mental health implications of involvement with EA (suicides and depression..)

It's kind of clique-y, which makes it difficult for people on the fringes to find out what people are thinking/prioritizing, to find jobs, etc. This might be necessary to some degree, and my experience with this is probably biased by not being that active online. But I'd nudge the community towards having more ways to onboard enthusiastic people than "work at an EA org" / "live in Berkeley" / "go to EA Global".

Improve the mathematics and cost/beneift analyses. The best  EA tutorial is the one involving gold mining by someone who i think was at Oxford.  That sums it up but then you have to get more complicated. That video is equivalent to explaining quantum theory and relativity as saying 'matter  is both a wave and a particle' and'space-time-matter is a curved or Reimannian space'. Both sort of true but you need more details.

Become more approachable for people who aren't in the 99th percentile of ambitious nerdishness

I sometimes feel it's a bit too philosophical. Also, I think it would be important for the community to integrate more in the social space, I feel it is sometimes quite disconnected from the rest of the world

Get / keep people more involved in local EA organization.

Take our inclusivity problems seriously. Women and people of color routinely feel uncomfortable, and when they make complaints they routinely feel that they are not believed, that appropriate weight is not given to their concerns, or that appropriate action is not taken. At best, we're losing out on promising talent and ideas. At worst, we're setting ourselves up for a PR blunder that could destroy the movement as we know it. This is not a pet cause, it's an existential risk to the movement.

More outreach to faith communities. Lots of altruism going on there, but much of it is ineffective.

Shut up about AI. Help the poor.

Itâ€™s a lot easier to be a community if itâ€™s fun. As it is I have to actively involve myself.

People in the community can be abrasive. It makes it intimidating to get involved in the community/discussions if you aren't as knowledgeable about all the research that has been done or what topics have already been discussed.

Be more welcoming towards "beginners"  Grow more diverse

Broader outreach - wider demographic, beyond our usual English-speaking, US/UK, Ivy-League-esque, geeky male crowd.  I don't want this to become a distracting identity politics shtick, but I *do* strongly believe we'll accomplish more (and make a better impression) if we improve at this.  I'd be in favor of leading orgs like CEA, GiveWell, etc hiring staff to focus specifically on this (eg, translation, funding of groups/events outside our usual range, HR hires to work on diversity, etc): I would pay for this myself.  I look at communities I'm familiar with like Bitcoin and video games and they are a mess and we should learn from their mistakes, including not just mistakes of commission but also of omission.

More emphasis on community mental health. I'm worried about the apparent high prevalence of mood problems among EAs.

More friendly culture, less pretentious/elitist attitudes (maybe worse in the bay area?)

A lot of members come across so formal and serious - it's not a particularly warm or welcoming environment for people who are new to the concept. A lot of members also seem to lose sympathy for people having more personal feelings on certain topics over purely effective or objective stances.

Recommending effective environmental charities, using similar metrics to those for human or farm animal-based charities.

More focus on political questions - governance, institutions, lobbying, policy change.

While I have been very warmly welcomed & supported as a volunteer for SHIC, I have struggled to feel part of the wider EA community. I live & work near two very active EA groups - Warwick & Oxford, but these are basically student societies from which I feel quite excluded as a professional. I also applied for coaching with 80,000 hours about a year ago and heard nothing back. Even if they felt I wasnâ€™t a priority for coaching, it would be good to know. Likewise I was encouraged to go to EA global but once the details were published it was made clear it wasnâ€™t intended for the likes of me (i.e. a normal working person, not an academic or working for an EA org), so I did not attend. These have contributed to me losing some motivation with my EA career & donation goals, as I feel somewhat discouraged & disheartened. While social media provides an alternative, I feel discouraged from engaging with that now having not felt part of other aspects of the community. Therefore an improvement to the community could be either more accessibility to & inclusion of â€˜civiliansâ€™, and/or greater transparency about who is a priority for organisations, so people donâ€™t waste their time trying to engage with parts of the community where they are not wanted or needed.

Become more open to dialogue, engage with other institutions more (think tanks, parties, ...)

1. Use less jargon  2. Lessen dependence on utilitarianism, other philosophical stances can also provide a justification for EA  3. Keep hyper-rationalism in check (in my view there is no meaningful way to REALLY do cause prioritization, for example, so finding a "model" for everything is an activity that for sure can appeal to some minds but scares some people off if it starts looking like THE overarching priority, over and above actually helping), encouraging people to think about the effectiveness of their donations is good enough and goes a long way already

Simplify and engage

Have high epistemic standards, good rational discussion norms, coupled with zero tolerance for aggressive and demeaning behavior

The EA community should explore the options for an EA startup incubator. This could lower entry barriers for effective effective organisations.

I would include Compassion in World Farming as one of the major animal rights organizations. Strong reason to think they're #1 in this field, given the massive effects of getting companies to move away from factory farming.

Get a good directory of the good explanations of complex ideas. MacAskill's book is great, but it only scratches the surface. The rest comes from reading online, but this online reading isn't neatly compiled into one place. Doing that would make discovering EA easier.

Bigger hats

Certainly, just can't come up with them now.

Systematize our approach to questions that are politically contentious. We need to have a space for people to have conversations that is insulated from the generally poor standard of conversation online. Right now those conversations are happening in ways that don't foster good conversation and isolate potential allies.

See PlanUSA for a way to make donor "feel good" by connecting them to a real person (who is only indirectly benefitting).

Be more like habitat for humanity

Some of it feels unnecessarily competitive - if it's not improving the world to ensure you have the "best" people for some thing then community is always more important imo

increase diversity

It could be more of a community, focused on growth. There does not seem to be sufficient focus on outreach nor any good starter material (the ea.org site is a great beginning, the new handbook as well, though it is focused too much on future risk and a bit biased in that respect). Still we lack like a nice introductory animated video, a beginner's chat, stuff like that.    It's hard to get new ideas launched. Often good ideas are shared, criticized (rightly so), and then things get stuck. Even though an idea is considered good and feasible, no one seems to care to execute it or help executing it.    Also, there seems to be little interest in "bonding" between members. It is as if we try to avoid being a community, which as a strategy could make sense, but I feel that although the philosophy behind EA is one of the most important ethical truths to me, I get alienated a bit, don't really feel connected and that there are not many people out there who are equally passionate about doing something with it (often, as said before, it's a once in a while discussion of an idea, nothing more, no action, no outreach)

Consider non-utilitarian and non-statistical methods for evaluation. Build deeper models. Don't judge people who disagree as evil.

Online community (and to lesser extent, in person community) can still be very hostile, especially for women. In particular, discussion from prominent people in EA around the role of women as being to serve men, and sex being something that women owe men continues to inhibit my enthusiasm for participating in the EA community.  More generally I am concerned about an ongoing focus on "elite" people, such that the perspectives of minority groups are ignored, leaving the EA community open to bias and at risk of perpetuating/worsening inequities into the future, particularly given the increasing focus on impacting the far future. Sure, we need to focus on reaching people with the most resources, but I think we need to value diversity of experience as a resource in itself.

People gain too much status by promoting certain charities rather than the cause-neutral methodology. AMF or MIRI are idols of worship that one sacrifices money to.   People don't explore enough. They don't think enough.  They think that Donating To Specific Charities is what EA is.  There are too many optics pressures.  The identity 'EA' is overused.   People still don't try to calculate value enough.  People reinvent the wheel too much, especially in the rationality community.  There should be more focus on the longterm future.  It's fucking cringey when "longterm future" is used to mean "giving Yudkowsky a nice couch" rather than the infinity of things that the future encompasses amongst all relevant EA considerations. And people LUMP together all of these different things into that. Partly to appeal to people who are more societally normative or of lesser intelligence.  Why dumb things down? What does that get you?  Why do people get so sensitive about PR issues regarding specific actions? If the movement really is that fucking fragile, what is the point? And what about the positive externalities of ideological conflict?   80000 Hours is not SCALABLE. Why the fuck don't they train career coaches or even peer-to-peer career counselling?   And why do EAs continue to promote their coaching when most don't get in? It connotes elitism. It doesn't solve the fucking problem of helping people figure out what to do with their lives that it's touted to do. It's not all that it's cracked up to be.  There's too much of a political bias in EA.  Open Phil is too centralized.  Individuals don't take enough responsibility for doing the most good.  CEA and other orgs don't seem that transparent? What are they even up to? What do they do?  The EA funds should be more decentralized.  There could be more coordination mechanisms.  Focus on high school students not college ceteris paribus, as college students' heads have been loaded with so much more signalling and capitalism, less room for idealism and focus on direct work.  Older and more competent people would be even better.

I would participate in the forum, but it is still not secured with https, allowing third parties to read and modify all data including passwords.

I do not.

Attitude of humility--I've even found myself picking up a prevalent attitude of "we know best" which is not only alienating when doing outreach/events but also likely actively prevents us from finding the best solutions

provide a much wider range of charities for people to support.  Helping the world's poorest people is only one way to do good.

Maybe use an easier language so it's easier for new potentiel EA-people to grasp the concepts. I think many people feel immediately when they get in contact with this concepts that it is very complicated stuff and something smart people do. I think this can have bad implications so that a lot of people who has "the heart at the right place" get frightened and don't participate in the community because it feels like the environment is to academic and/or intellectual.

- better coordination between orgs & local & student groups  - more involvement of the 'target' individuals (e.g. ppl from developing countries) in higher level EA movement direction decisions

A better pipeline to train potential talented people. We have many inexperienced, but bright and motivated young people.

Oh.... awks..... I wrote a long spiel about this on the previous page already

allow different ways to measure effectiveness than lives saved;  sites like givewell should allow for more personal constraints in the evaluations of the charity (like people thinking the concept of charity is wrong and should be replaced by solidarity; suggesting effective ways to donate money for a certain cause like enviromental issues etc.)

Move off of Facebook.

Become more introspective and more human

More outreach

Far more diversity, and less of an overt focus on AI safety

It really seems like 80,000 hours is focused on people who want STEM or finance related work. But if I want to make money to donate, it is important to me that I have some kind of fulfilling career (my field is closer to art and media).    I'm not bad at math and I could go into a mathy field if I focused my efforts there, but if I just pick the most lucrative career that makes me miserable, I'll probably fail to make any money at it anyway because people who interview me for work will be able to tell I don't really want the job.

Goood question.   I do not know that much about you even though my flat mate is involved in your community. Maybe I should go to a local meetup.

Make younger individuals, especially those in colleges and sixth forms, more aware if the important of the effective altruism movement.

Better selection of who to collaborate with based on rigour of thinking, an openness to changing decisions based on feedback, and general capability to contribute in the field you're looking to build partnerships.

1) Do more centralised fundraising drives! So much evidence this works!!    2) The capture of EA by Silicon Valley types is deeply detrimental to attracting people who want to do the most good. This is the big blindspot of EA right now, and there's too much groupthink to see it. If anything is to be the downfall of the movement over the next 10 years, this is, I think, the most likely candidate. Alas, nothing will change...

Do many people actually manage to fill in this survey fully?

More focus on Environmentalism and Political reform

Focus/ value empathy more rather than assigning high status to top researchers only. This may attract the wrong types of people who can debate and understand the topic well but have fewer interest in actually being effective, I.e. put rubber on the road + it might lead to newcomers not feeling welcome. If we preach that being an EA means being extremely altruistic and smart about it, we should also focus on the empathy part rather than only the smart part. Iâ€™d want EA to be attractive to 110iq eas who give 30% of their income as well as 140iq eas who give 1% (consider this a metaphor).    Also, EA lends itself to being misunderstood in terms of how clear our recommendations are, think QALY/ dollar. This can make us seem naive towards people in the field, if we donâ€™t promote these ideas with caution.

More explicit evaluations of things, and engaged discussion of them.

Independent outside audits (unless these are too expensive, or already happening)

1) Tap into the existing large amount of Christian charity by A) identifying effective Christian charities, B) encouraging the use of evidence-based research among Christian charities, and C) developing/mentoring effective Christian charities. See the work of Dr. Bruce Wydick & compassion for an example.    2) Provide advice around tax-effective donations

Get more members. This group needs to be more welcoming.

some way for us to help each other with not-directly-EA-relate tasks, kind of like that old page of things we needed or could help with, but with more activity

I think sometimes risk aversion prevents good ideas from being tried in the community when a careful Fermi Estimate would suggest they are positive expected value

Target average individuals. That is individuals without a degree from a top university. Else sooner or later EA will be discredited as the elitist society it is.

Expand beyond California, help people find the companies that help the most, change the world by discouraging greed and helping people understand that money is only a tool, not a goal.

Probably stop hanging out with the LessWrong people

The local Berlin EA community needs to improve the feeling of being a social group, so that new members get motivated

average EA only donates 3% which is pretty pathetic

Find a new name for the AI doomsday cult stuff and use "EA" for the practical real-world stuff, so it's more palatable to the average person?

Less weird

Get people to be more serious and detailed about cause prioritization

Not really. I am not so much into it yet, but everything I have seen thus far look really great

The Centre for effective altruism seems like it's doing a poor job as the "leader" of effective altruism. I'm not particularly well-informed on this issue, though. EA's are also still not nearly as cause neutral as they could be.

Maybe a higher profile, as many/most people donate to 'less effective' charities.

More recruitment / self-advertising - we need more EAs!

more diversity (racial, gender, education, ideas)

I'd encourage you to look at social investment as well as donations.

More diversity, more outreach! At my university there are lots of charity societies - loads of people working hard to do good, but mostly doing so ineffectively because they don't know we exist.

Be more inclusive in order to be less elitist, white, and male.

Particularly with respect to my local SÃ£o Paulo group, I would like to see a greater focus on rationality and better thinking in the EA community. I think that is massively important for EAs.

Experiments like Greg Colbourn's EA hotel seem like an interesting way forward - seeing if EAs can save time and money by working together in ways that wouldn't make sense in society at large. Other thoughts here:  http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1k6/the_almighty_hive_will/    Would be nice to encourage it to be less jargony    Suspect EA orgs should experiment more with hiring (and if need be paying substantially more for) consummate professionals than people who necessarily identify as EA. Some of them seem to be run and/or staffed by people with more enthusiasm than competence

The community is becoming obsessed with theoretical risks and investigations into areas like AI which already receive enormous amounts of government and commercial funding. This is not the purpose of the movement, this is not related to the founding principle. The original purpose was to do the most good with available resources, taking into account how those particular resources would be used. The idea of EAs choosing their own causes would have been baffling 10 years ago. Yet now EA organisations have been overrun with this attitude and the belief that existential threats are priority despite the fact that they are largely a focus of government and commercial research.    EA is also becoming worse in terms of being male dominated. As it becomes more of an online community, it becomes more sexist, egotistical and patronising. The assumption any male makes of any female within the community is that she knows less about EA than he, that she is more recent to join, and that if she speaks to him she must want to date him. This is appalling. There are increasingly visible women within the community, which is progress, but the culture overall is getting worse.    Also, the next set of questions in this survey use male gender as default. Why? Think about what this says to people who read it.

- Better on-boarding, some way to not make it feel like a bait and switch (ex. global health as public face and then x-risk as what we actually care about)  - Better way to understand and support community mental health

grow

Sell itself to universities more. Fund presentations for business students at the best business schools.

I sense that EA as a whole is still not taking AI seriously enough. We should be preparing for 10 year timelines to AGI, as a bad but fairly plausible trajectory, with a slow takeoff in the Christiano sense (things start getting wild within just a few years).

Make more events - to spread the word

Outreach partnerships with media personalitites

The EA community is a privileged, unwelcoming community of highly educated people who seem detached from the middle class world.

I think there is an opportunity to engage with experienced individuals who have worked in powerful positions in government, business, etc. to understand more about how EAs can further causes through such organisations. My experience suggests huge improvements can be made in the performance of organisations of all kinds. All of the causes we care about as EAs need to be furthered by organisations, but we donâ€™t talk about how best to do this, or whatâ€™s difference we can make.

I know you hate this, but please stop ignoring politics. Global political systems define the rules of the game and the overall possibility frontier for all of your activities. The magnitude is huge!    I am suspicious of your not-really-apolitcal stance. You invite white supremacist Trumpist speakers like Peter Thiel to talk at your events - is the additional AI research funding worth it? As long as you answer "yes" .. what's the end point of EA? I can see the move towards only AI research and away from saving lives and reducing poverty, and I don't like it. Let climate change disasters come, let poverty increase, but hey, at least there is no AI apocalypse and a minority of rich white guys enjoy extended lives in the future dystopia! Is that the vision? What's the vision? BAU of global inequality + preventing AI apocalypse?

Be more open to other non-utilitarian ethical approaches to EA (deontologist EA, religious EA, etc)

Look for more ways to make use of people who don't have technical degrees and can't go back to school to get them.  In general, try to appeal more to people who aren't (a.) in school, (b.) just starting their careers, or (c.) independently wealthy.

Make more local groups, like in Phoenix. And have someone who monitors them so that groups don't stagnate. For ex. there's a Meetup group in Phoenix that exists but the leaders don't do anything. Idk if it's an option but I would lead if I could.

More online (talking) events via Skype

People find the concept of "ranking" charities very cold, I think, it turns people away to use that sort of language and framing.

Add a larger volunteer component, especially targeting those problems/spaces that have talent gaps the crowd can be a powerful tool.

Too late. EA is being overrun by right-wing nutjobs acting in bad faith, nothing can be done.

I'm not involved much so I don't know, but maybe focusing on making small improvements in the habits of people who make the worst choices rather than optimising nerds who like math.    Also, maybe less focus on lives saved? I'm a bit unusual among the EA/rationalist/etc community in that I think death is bad, but not the worst thing ever. I care about quality of life more than many do, I think.

I wish I would have heard of this in college. Maybe there is a way to reach college students as they are graduating and transitioning into financial independence?

I think it needs to be careful to keep itself welcoming of EA-types who are not rationalists or rationalist-like. There is some creeping in this direction to the exclusion of other EA personality types which I think does not benefit us as a movement. (To be clear, this is not about cause prioritization concerns., I think the pivot to x-risk and AI is sensible, this is about intra-community cultural and communication norms and how welcoming we are of committed people with different personality types.

Be less elitist - see the argument e.g. by Robin Hanson about signaling - the strategy to start at the top of the market (the richest and smartest e.g. Elon Musk) is a good one - but one shall have also an ambition to create a version of EA for the masses (think Tesla Model 3) because once the EA becomes mainstream - people will want to signal that they are EA.

- I love the EA community so the main thing I want the community to do is keep up the awesomeness. But I think thereâ€™s always going to be room for improvement because weâ€™re all human and fallible.    - I think Giving What We Can should not recommend EA Funds as the main/first choice for Giving What We Can members. At least for poverty-related causes, people should be recommended to refer to GiveWell, rather than a single person in EA Funds. To be clear, I am not against the existence of EA Funds, it just seems to me that by recommending that everyone donates to EA Funds as the first choice, rather than inviting them to read reviews of different charities and rather than referring to GiveWell, this is signalling that GWWC wants you to just trust whichever EA Fund manager is running the fund you choose to donate to. EA Fund managers are so different to GiveWell (I mean, GiveWell is composed of a full team of researchers who work together to evaluate many different charities, to see where the best giving opportunities are â€“ thatâ€™s much more rigorous than if you just ask one individual to make the decisions). EA Fund managers, to me, seem a step away from literature reviews and evidence-based recommendations, and a step towards letting EA thought leaders decide whatâ€™s important based on their personal opinions. So, to me, recommending EA Funds as the default donation option sounds unscientific and is at odds with the things I most love about EA as a concept. I think GWWC should recommend independent charity evaluators for the cause areas where these exist, namely for global poverty (GiveWell) and animal welfare (Animal Charity Evaluators).    - I also miss the days when GWWC was evaluating charities and producing reports on them in order to make charity recommendations. The main thing I miss is being able to recommend an up-to-date review of Cool Earth to environmentally-minded friends.     - I think it would be beneficial if the 80,000 Hours problem quiz (https://80000hours.org/problem-quiz/) was displayed or linked to prominently at the very start of the 80,000 Hours page containing the rankings of the world's most pressing cause areas (https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/). I think it would be best to increase the emphasis on the fact that the rankings are *according to the values and opinions of the staff of 80,000 Hours* rather than the rankings of the world's most important cause areas, full stop. I do think it's awesome that the list exists, and that you can read the criteria upon which the scores are based. However, I think that it would be preferable if the link to the problem quiz (https://80000hours.org/problem-quiz/) was more prominent, so that it is as clear as possible to people reading the page that the rankings depend very much on certain beliefs about the way the world is, as well as certain values regarding who and what to prioritise. I think it would also be great to emphasise (as they do in other articles) that the most important thing for an individual to work on depends on the way the world is and also on their own background, skills, opportunities, interests, motivation and so on. Having said this, I love the fact that 80K did outline the criteria they used to rank the cause areas. This keeps the process transparent and avoids the risk of suggesting that there's only one way to rank things.    - I think it would be wonderful if Students for High Impact Charity received more attention and support from the EA community. Full disclosure: I'm a big fan of them and I volunteered for them for a while. Theyâ€™re a great team and I think itâ€™s brilliant that they are introducing school students to the ideas of EA.    - I think the community needs to be more cautious before recommending publicly against certain traditional ways of doing good. I think itâ€™s important to avoid contrarianism just for the sake of contrarianism.    - I think too many people in the community accept the ideas that others put forward, without researching those ideas themselves. This can lead to the unfortunate situation where people are promoting evidence-based this or that, while referring to second-hand information they heard from a thought leader, rather than going and researching the topic they are talking about themselves in detail.     - On a related note, I think sometimes people exaggerate the evidence supporting certain views, and I think thatâ€™s dangerous. I find it problematic when people talk about the evidence for something as if they are very confident about the conclusions (or even think others are silly for thinking differently), when in some cases the evidence isnâ€™t sufficient to reach a conclusion.    - I think the EA community, on average, should be more humble (in terms of both epistemic humility and humility in everyday social interactions) and I think we should be trying harder to be welcoming to everyone. On a related note, perhaps because EA is so self-promoting and perhaps because the title itself implies a claim of superiority (compared to other ways of doing good), EA is sometimes abused as a way for narcissists to get ego boosts. I think this pattern is really disconcerting: it does a massive disservice to the many people who are into EA for the right reasons (i.e. to actually do good), and I think it makes the public suspicious of the motives of the EA community in general.    - EA seems to place a lesser â€œvalueâ€ù on people who donâ€™t have as much potential to do good most effectively. Looking at the arguments made about effective careers, earning to give and so forth, it seems that it is assumed (by many in EA) that there wonâ€™t be as much altruistic â€œpotentialâ€ù among people with lower educational levels, people with lower earning potential, lower social capital, and/or lower IQ, people who are differently-abled, and people with fewer years left of life. Some people see this as able-ist, ageist and elitist. I'm not sure what to do about this, apart from catching myself any time I am assuming someone may not be able to do something - I try to assume everyone can do what they put their mind to (unless they literally prove otherwise).

1. Safe decentralization from two major hubs to local groups  2. More transparency, friendly feedback and external audits  3. More intellectual diversity and identifying novel cause areas  4. More responsiveness and self-correcting mechanisms  5. Better information flow  6. Game-theoretic adjustments to moral considerations  7. More emphasis on volunteers' mental well-being and financial situation

focus on universally obviously good causes

Expand into political and economic cause areas, provide budget examples, expand diversity of the community

More support for charities doing EA outreach - like Rethink Charity

Focus on local first

It's already an awesome community compared to other communities with much higher standards than average! But in some local groups, I guess, it could become warmer (not in mine though). I recently heard that the local group in Berlin once thought about an IQ test/barrier for members, which is outrageous! I sincerely hope that no one outside the community ever gets to hear this! And it shifted my perception of the group leader into a quite negative direction although I had heard not-so-nice-things about him before...

Stop treating people as fungible. There are all sorts of things which change a person's value.

This has nothing to do with the other questions, but I feel like there should be a bit more emphasis on following your values by acting on your own level around you. I agree with the fact that we should allocate ressources to where they help the most, but it is also important to keep some of the ressources to act in an altruistic manner that is maybe less effective but gives live to those values and aligns our own acts and everyday life with the bigger goal. For exemple, donating to the right charity is as valuable as giving a bite to eat to the guy freezing in the cold outside your building -or inviting him in- in creating a better world. It is not only about less disease and hunger (which is of course very good) but also about more compassion and helping each other out when in need.   End of rambling by a "regular" altruist ;)

Signposting to volunteeting opportunities (aside from community building)

Less tech and science jargon. More focus on global poverty and health, less on AI and other tech that is less accessible to many.

Better forum - separate the forum into different sections (like poverty, AI, off topic, etc)

Try to include people who are in different personal situations: not in the top 20%, people who are not just starting their careers, people with less education or resources to choose their own career...

Keep the overall message simple. Movements have a tendency to dissintigrate when the ideology becomes very complicated.

Increase epistemic modesty/reduce confidence. Examples of overconfidence as I see it: how much EA Funds is recommended by 80,000 hours and CEA, and making donations on the judgement of individual fund managers; Holden Karnofsky joining OpenAI's board of directors (I'm skeptical of the marginal benefit of this); general confidence in the current most recommended and discussed cause areas (I do not think moral uncertainty is taken seriously enough).

Yes. Yes I do. Since this box is small, I will simply say: Stop it with the causal decision theory and direct first-order consequentialism, and rejection of illegible effects, and inability to cooperate with those around you or treat them as more important than random people half a world away. Cultivate virtue. Be good people locally and concretely first, not only abstractly. Take more risk of being wrong, consider evidence even when you can't prove things, man this is gonna get long so I'll stop there.

Do more to support/benefit those already in EA. Outreach/expansion is great, but I've seen a lot of effort wasted trying to win over people that reject the EA approach while there are also those that believe in EA but leave the community b/c it wasn't adding anything to their lives.

When reaching out to people who are unfamiliar with EA, avoid using over-jargonized descriptions.

More focus on smaller charities, as they have less overhead and can be more impact-full.

Stop linking effective altruism so strongly to utilitarianism, or unusual fringe beliefs like AI risk. Many people find it hard to disagree with the simple argument: 1) We should give more to charity than we currently do. 2) When giving to charity, we should try to make our donations as effective as possible to solve the issue we want to solve.  The core of EA is not nearly as controversial as the movement has become.

Create an overview of tax deductability of effective charities for all wealthy countries. I missed some deductions last year, which I consider a missed opportunity to give more

Less classism and less focus on elites/wealthy people

It needs to be more welcoming and less abrasive. I have encountered many people who get turned off not by the ideas, but by the people. We need to get better at training people to talk well about EA stuff. I've seen some great emails about this but maybe more directive training would be great.

Be more welcoming of people with different values, different backgrounds and different levels of ability to apply their effectiveness conclusions to their lives (eg make career changes or donate huge sums). Also, empathy is not opposed to rationality. Stop painting it that way, that's part of why you exclude women. I am one of the most rational people I've met. I'm also one of the most empathic.

Become less stereotypically elitist -- focus on how much potential a person actually has to contribute meaningfully rather than on markers of elitism (phd's from high quality schools are good positive signals but the lack of them is not a strong negative).    Focus more on local community health (stop burning people out/using them up and spitting them out).    Be open to advocating things that work best when lots of people do them, separately from EA branding (e.g. do things that cause especially good charities etc to become popular, even if the people who jump on the bandwagon don't do it for EA reasons).    Directly help people who are struggling as a result of EA style thinking (look at the EA Peer Support FB group for examples).

less pushing veganism on people, especially on those who can't be vegan for health reasons

Much less public hedonistic weirdness, and even more humility vis a vis the common man

Better storytelling to engage and motivate action. More informative events locally rather than only informal meet-ups.

Keep getting better at rationality.

More diversity (gender, ethnicity and subjects)  Friendlier fb-group  Matching low-skill volunteers better with volunteering opportunities  Matching small donors better with small underfunded organisations

More broader topics. Your priority analyses might be right but I have seen zero information on any sort of EA for electrical engineering. You are neglecting an entire, super high potential, super high capital sector of industry! I struggled to find a single electrical engineer in EA and I've been immersed in EA theory and social groups for two years now.

To participate of the altuism action.  If the person participates of the action, he will give more resources.

Let more people know about it. Hear people's stories

Whatever results in clearing talent gaps, do it. 80k hours is a godsend in this area but it still feels like there's low-hanging fruit in finding driven people that can specialize into whatever's needed.

Shift away from fb. EA is one of the last reasons I am still on there and I would like to leave.    Organize activities that everyone in the community can contribute to. For example, do a contest for creative advertisements for EA, share personal EA stories, etc.

Think outside of the system (capitalism) not inside. Please.

Less of a nerd/cult culture to make more welcoming to others
